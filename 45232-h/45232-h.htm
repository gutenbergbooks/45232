<small>LOST IN THE MINE.</small></h2>


<p>The Dryden Mine, in the Susquehanna
coal-fields of Pennsylvania, was worked
out and abandoned long ago. To-day its
headings and airways and chambers echo
only to the occasional fall of loosened slate,
or to the drip of water from the roof. Its
pillars, robbed by retreating workmen, are
crumbling and rusty, and those of its props
which are still standing have become
mouldy and rotten. The rats that once
scampered through its galleries deserted it
along with human kind, and its very name,
from long disuse, has acquired an unaccustomed
sound.</p>

<p>But twenty years ago there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
busier mine than the Dryden from Carbondale
to Nanticoke. Two hundred and
thirty men and boys went by the slope into
it every morning, and came out from it
every night. They were simple and unlearned,
these men and boys, rugged and
rude, rough and reckless at times, but
manly, heroic, and kindhearted.</p>

<p>Up in the Lackawanna region a strike
had been in progress for nearly two weeks.
Efforts had been made by the strikers to
persuade the miners down the valley to
join them, but at first without success.</p>

<p>Then a committee of one hundred came
down to appeal and to intimidate. In
squads of ten or more they visited the
mines in the region, and, in the course of
their journeyings, had come to the Dryden
Slope. They had induced the miners to
go out at all the workings they had thus
far entered, and were no less successful
here. It required persuasion, sometimes
threats, sometimes, indeed, even blows, for
the miners in Dryden Slope had no cause
of complaint against their employers; they
earned good wages, and were content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>But, twenty years ago, miners who kept
at work against the wishes of their fellows
while a strike was in progress, were called
“black-legs,” were treated with contempt,
waylaid and beaten, and sometimes killed.</p>

<p>So the men in the Dryden Mine yielded;
and soon, down the chambers and along
the headings, toward the foot of the slope,
came little groups, with dinner-pails and
tools, discussing earnestly, often bitterly,
the situation and the prospect.</p>

<p>The members of a party of fifteen or
twenty, that came down the airway from the
tier of chambers on the new north heading,
were holding an especially animated conversation.
Fully one-half of the men
were visiting strikers. They were all
walking, in single file, along the route by
which the mine-cars went.</p>

<p>For some distance from the new chambers
the car-track was laid in the airway;
then it turned down through an entrance
into the heading, and from that point followed
the heading to the foot of the slope.
Where the route crossed from the airway
to the heading, the space between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pillars had been carefully boarded across,
so that the air current should not be turned
aside; and a door had been placed in the
boarding, to be opened whenever the cars
approached, and shut as soon as they had
passed by.</p>

<p>That door was attended by a boy.</p>

<p>To this point the party had now come,
and one by one filed through the opening,
while Bennie, the door-boy, stood holding
back the door to let them pass.</p>

<p>“Ho, Jack, tak’ the door-boy wi’ ye!”
shouted some one in the rear.</p>

<p>The great, broad-shouldered, rough-bearded
man who led the procession turned
back to where Bennie, apparently lost in
astonishment at this unusual occurrence,
still stood, with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>“Come along, lad!” he said; “come
along! Ye’ll have a gret play-spell noo.”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave the door, sir,” answered
Bennie. “The cars’ll be comin’ soon.”</p>

<p>“Ye need na min’ the cars. Come along
wi’ ye, I say!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t go till Tom comes, anyway,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The man came a step closer. He had
the frame of a giant. The others who
passed by were like children beside him.
Then one of the men who worked in the
mine, and who knew Bennie, came through
the doorway, the last in the group, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt the boy; let him alone.
His brother’ll take him out; he always
does.”</p>

<p>All this time Bennie stood quite still,
with his hand on the door, never turning
his head.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing for a boy to stand
motionless like that, and look neither to
the right nor the left, while an excited
group of men passed by, one of whom
had stopped and approached him, as if he
meant him harm. It roused the curiosity
of “Jack the Giant,” as the miners called
him, and, plucking his lamp from his cap,
he flashed the light of it up into Bennie’s
face.</p>

<p>The boy did not stir; no muscle of his
face moved; even his eyes remained open
and fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, lad! lad! What’s the matter wi’
ye?” There was tenderness in the giant’s
voice as he spoke, and tenderness in his
bearded face as Bennie answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t you know? I’m blind.”</p>

<p>“Blind! An’ a-workin’ i’ the mines?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a body don’t have to see to ’tend
door, you know. All I’ve to do is to open
it when I hear the cars a-comin’, an’ to
shut it when they get by.”</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s true; but ye did na get
here alone. Who helpit ye?”</p>

<p>Bennie’s face lighted up with pleasure, as
he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Tom! He helps me. I
couldn’t get along without him; I couldn’t
do <em>any thing</em> without Tom.”</p>

<p>The man’s interest and compassion had
grown, as the conversation lengthened, and
he was charmed by the voice of the child.
It had in it that touch of pathos that often
lingers in the voices of the blind. He
would hear more of it.</p>

<p>“Sit ye, lad,” he said; “sit ye, an’ tell
me aboot Tom, an’ aboot yoursel’, an’ a’ ye
can remember.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they sat down on the rude bench
together, with the roughly hewn pillar of
coal at their backs, blind Bennie and Jack
Rennie, the giant, and while one told the
story of his blindness, and his blessings,
and his hopes, the other listened with
tender earnestness, almost with tears.</p>

<p>Bennie told first about Tom, his brother,
who was fourteen years old, two years older
than himself. Tom was so good to him;
and Tom could see, could see as well as
anybody. “Why,” he exclaimed, “Tom
can see <em>every thing</em>!”</p>

<p>Then he told about his blindness; how
he had been blind ever since he could
remember. But there was a doctor, he
said, who came up once from Philadelphia
to visit Major Dryden, before the major
died; and he had chanced to see Tom and
Bennie up by the mines, and had looked
at Bennie’s eyes, and said he thought, if
the boy could go to Philadelphia and have
treatment, that sight might be restored.</p>

<p>Tom asked how much it would cost, and
the doctor said, “Oh, maybe a hundred
dollars;” and then some one came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
called the doctor away, and they had never
seen him since.</p>

<p>But Tom resolved that Bennie should go
to Philadelphia, if ever he could save money
enough to send him.</p>

<p>Tom was a driver-boy in Dryden Slope,
and his meagre earnings went mostly to
buy food and clothing for the little family.
But the dollar or two that he had been
accustomed to spend each month for himself
he began now to lay aside for Bennie.</p>

<p>Bennie knew about it, of course, and
rejoiced greatly at the prospect in store for
him, but expressed much discontent because
he, himself, could not help to obtain
the fund which was to cure him. Then
Tom, with the aid of the kindhearted mine
superintendent, found employment for his
brother as a door-boy in Dryden Slope, and
Bennie was happy. It wasn’t absolutely
necessary that a door-boy should see; if
he had good hearing he could get along
very well.</p>

<p>So every morning Bennie went down the
slope with Tom, and climbed into an empty
mine-car, and Tom’s mule drew them, rattling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
along the heading, till they reached,
almost a mile from the foot of the slope,
the doorway where Bennie staid.</p>

<p>Then Tom went on, with the empty cars,
up to the new tier of chambers, and brought
the loaded cars back. Every day he passed
through Bennie’s doorway on three round
trips in the forenoon, and three round trips
in the afternoon; and every day, when the
noon-hour came, he stopped on the down-trip,
and sat with Bennie on the bench by
the door, and both ate from one pail the
dinner prepared for them by their mother.</p>

<p>When quitting time came, and Tom went
down to the foot of the slope with his last
trip for the day, Bennie climbed to the top
of a load, and rode out, or else, with his
hands on the last car of the trip, walked
safely along behind.</p>

<p>“And Tom and me together have a’most
twenty dollars saved now!” said the boy
exultingly. “An’ we’ve only got to get
eighty dollars more, an’ then I can go an’
buy back the sight into my eyes; an’ then
Tom an’ me we’re goin’ to work together
all our lives. Tom, he’s goin’ to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
chamber an’ be a miner, an’ I’m goin’ to
be Tom’s laborer till I learn how to mine,
an’ then we’re goin’ to take a contract
together, an’ hire laborers, an’ get rich, an’
then&mdash;why, then Mommie won’t have to
work any more!”</p>

<p>It was like a glimpse of a better world
to hear this boy talk. The most favored
child of wealth that ever revelled seeing in
the sunlight has had no hope, no courage,
no sublimity of faith, that could compare
with those of this blind son of poverty and
toil. He had his high ambition, and that
was to work. He had his sweet hope to
be fulfilled, and that was to see. He had
his earthly shrine, and that was where his
mother sat. And he had his hero of
heroes, and that was Tom.</p>

<p>There was no quality of human goodness,
or bravery, or excellence of any kind,
that he did not ascribe to Tom. He would
sooner have disbelieved all of his four remaining
senses than have believed that Tom
would say an unkind word to Mommie or
to him, or be guilty of a mean act towards
any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Bennie’s faith in Tom was fully justified.
No nineteenth century boy could have
been more manly, no knight of old could
have been more true and tender, than was
Tom to the two beings whom he loved
best upon all the earth.</p>

<p>“But the father, laddie,” said Jack,
still charmed and curious; “whaur’s the
father?”</p>

<p>“Dead,” answered Bennie. “He came
from the old country first, an’ then he sent
for Mommie an’ us, an’ w’en we got here
he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that was awfu’ sad for the
mither! Took wi’ the fever, was he?”</p>

<p>“No; killed in the mine. Top coal fell
an’ struck him. That’s the way they found
him. We didn’t see him, you know. That
was two weeks before me an’ Tom an’
Mommie got here. I wasn’t but four years
old then, but I can remember how Mommie
cried. She didn’t have much time to
cry, though, ’cause she had to work so hard.
Mommie’s al’ays had to work so hard,”
added Bennie, reflectively.</p>

<p>The man began to move, nervously, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the bench. It was apparent that some
strong emotion was taking hold of him.
He lifted the lamp from his cap again and
held it up close to Bennie’s face.</p>

<p>“Killed, said ye&mdash;i’ the mine&mdash;top coal
fell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ struck him on the head; they
said he didn’t ever know what killed him.”</p>

<p>The brawny hand trembled so that the
flame from the spout of the little lamp went
up in tiny waves.</p>

<p>“Whaur&mdash;whaur happenit it&mdash;i’ what
place&mdash;i’ what mine?”</p>

<p>“Up in Carbondale. No. 6 shaft, I think
it was; yes, No. 6.”</p>

<p>Bennie spoke somewhat hesitatingly.
His quick ear had caught the change in
the man’s voice, and he did not know what
it could mean.</p>

<p>“His name, lad! gi’ me the father’s
name!”</p>

<p>The giant’s huge hand dropped upon
Bennie’s little one, and held it in a painful
grasp. The boy started to his feet in fear.</p>

<p>“You won’t hurt me, sir! Please don’t
hurt me; I can’t see!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not for the warld, lad; not for the
whole warld. But I must ha’ the father’s
name; tell me the father’s name, quick!”</p>

<p>“Thomas Taylor, sir,” said Bennie, as he
sank back, trembling, on the bench.</p>

<p>The lamp dropped from Jack Rennie’s
hand, and lay smoking at his feet. His
huge frame seemed to have shrunk by at
least a quarter of its size; and for many
minutes he sat, silent and motionless, seeing
as little of the objects around him as
did the blind boy at his side.</p>

<p>At last he roused himself, picked up his
lamp, and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, lad, Bennie, I mus’ be a-goin’;
good-by till ye. Will the brither come for
ye?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” answered Bennie, “Tom
al’ays stops for me; he aint come up from
the foot yet, but he’ll come.”</p>

<p>Rennie turned away, then turned back
again.</p>

<p>“Whaur’s the lamp?” he asked; “have
ye no licht?”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t ever have any. It wouldn’t
be any good to me, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the man started down the
heading, but, after he had gone a short distance,
a thought seemed to strike him, and
he came back to where Bennie was still
sitting.</p>

<p>“Lad, I thocht to tell ye; ye s’all go to
the city wi’ your eyes. I ha’ money to sen’
ye, an’ ye s’all go. I&mdash;I&mdash;knew&mdash;the
father, lad.”</p>

<p>Before Bennie could express his surprise
and gratitude, he felt a strong hand laid
gently on his shoulder, and a rough,
bearded face pressed for a moment against
his own, and then his strange visitor was
gone.</p>

<p>Down the heading the retreating footsteps
echoed, their sound swallowed up at
last in the distance; and up at Bennie’s
doorway silence reigned.</p>

<p>For a long time the boy sat, pondering
the meaning of the strange man’s words
and conduct. But the more he thought
about it the less able was he to understand
it. Perhaps Tom could explain it, though;
yes, he would tell Tom about it. Then it
occurred to him that it was long past time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for Tom to come up from the foot with his
last trip for the day. It was strange, too,
that the men should all go out together
that way; he didn’t understand it. But if
Tom would only come&mdash;</p>

<p>He rose and walked down the heading
a little way; then he turned and went up
through the door and along the airway;
then he came back to his bench again, and
sat down.</p>

<p>He was sure Tom would come; Tom
had never disappointed him yet, and he
knew he would not disappoint him for the
world if he could help it. He knew, too,
that it was long after quitting-time, and
there hadn’t been a sound, that he could
hear, in the mine for an hour, though he
had listened carefully.</p>

<p>After a while he began to grow nervous;
the stillness became oppressive; he could
not endure it. He determined to try to
find the way out by himself. He had
walked to the foot of the slope alone once,
the day Tom was sick, and he thought he
could do it again.</p>

<p>So he made sure that his door was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tightly closed, then he took his dinner-pail,
and started bravely down the heading,
striking the rails of the mine car-track on
each side with his cane as he went along,
to guide him.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would stop and listen, for
a moment, if, perchance, he might hear
Tom coming to meet him, or, possibly,
some belated laborer going out from another
part of the mine; then, hearing
nothing, he would trudge on again.</p>

<p>After a long time spent thus, he thought
he must be near the foot of the slope; he
knew he had walked far enough to be
there. He was tired, too, and sat down on
the rail to rest. But he did not sit there
long; he could not bear the silence, it was
too depressing, and after a very little while
he arose and walked on. The caps in the
track grew higher; once he stumbled over
one of them and fell, striking his side on
the rail. He was in much pain for a few
minutes; then he recovered and went on
more carefully, lifting his feet high with
every step, and reaching ahead with his
cane. But his progress was very slow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there came upon him the sensation
of being in a strange place. It did not
seem like the heading along which he went
to and from his daily work. He reached
out with his cane upon each side, and
touched nothing. Surely, there was no
place in the heading so wide as that.</p>

<p>But he kept on.</p>

<p>By-and-by he became aware that he was
going down a steep incline. The echoes
of his footsteps had a hollow sound, as
though he were in some wide, open space,
and his cane struck one, two, three, props
in succession. Then he knew he was
somewhere in a chamber; and knew, too,
that he was lost.</p>

<p>He sat down, feeling weak and faint,
and tried to think. He remembered that,
at a point in the heading about two-thirds
of the way to the foot, a passage branched
off to the right, crossed under the slope,
and ran out into the southern part of the
mine, where he had never been. He
thought he must have turned into this
cross-heading, and followed it, and if he
had, it would be hard indeed to tell where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he now was. He did not know whether to
go on or to turn back.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better, after all, to
sit still until help should come, though it
might be hours, or even days, before any
one would find him.</p>

<p>Then came a new thought. What would
Tom do? Tom would not know where he
had gone; he would never think of looking
for him away off here; he would go
up the heading to the door, and not finding
him there, would think that his brother had
already gone home. But when he knew
that Bennie was not at home, he would
surely come back to the mine to search
for him; he would come down the slope;
maybe he was, at that very moment, at the
foot; maybe Tom would hear him if he
should call, “Tom! O Tom!”</p>

<p>The loudest thunder-burst could not
have been more deafening to the frightened
child than the sound of his own voice,
as it rang out through the solemn stillness
of the mine, and was hurled back to his
ears by the solid masses of rock and coal
that closed in around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>A thousand echoes went rattling down
the wide chambers and along the narrow
galleries, and sent back their ghosts to play
upon the nervous fancy of the frightened
child. He would not have shouted like
that again if his life had depended on it.</p>

<p>Then silence fell upon him; silence like
a pall&mdash;oppressive, mysterious and awful
silence, in which he could almost hear the
beating of his own heart. He could not
endure that. He grasped his cane again
and started on, searching for a path, stumbling
over caps, falling sometimes, but on
and on, though never so slowly; on and
on until, faint and exhausted, he sank
down upon the damp floor of the mine,
with his face in his hands, and wept, in
silent agony, like the lost child that he
was.</p>

<p>Lost, indeed, with those miles and miles
of black galleries opening and winding and
crossing all around him, and he, lying prostrate
and powerless, alone in the midst of
that desolation.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>THE BURNED BREAKER.</small></h2>


<p>For a long time Bennie lay there, pitifully
weeping. Then, away off somewhere
in the mine, he heard a noise. He lifted
his head. By degrees the noise grew
louder; then it sounded almost like footsteps.
Suppose it were some one coming;
suppose it were Tom! The light
of hope flashed up in Bennie’s breast with
the thought.</p>

<p>But the sound ceased, the stillness settled
down more profoundly than before,
and about the boy’s heart the fear and
loneliness came creeping back. Was it
possible that the noise was purely imaginary?</p>

<p>Suddenly, tripping down the passages,
bounding from the walls, echoing through
the chambers, striking faintly, but, oh, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sweetly, upon Bennie’s ears, came the well-known
call,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ben-nie-e-e-e!”</p>

<p>The sound died away in a faint succession
of echoing <em>e</em>’s.</p>

<p>Bennie sprang to his feet with a cry.</p>

<p>“Tom! Tom! Tom, here I am.”</p>

<p>Before the echoes of his voice came back
to him they were broken by the sound of
running feet, and down the winding galleries
came Tom, as fast as his lamp and his
legs would take him, never stopping till he
and Bennie were in one another’s arms.</p>

<p>“Bennie, it was my fault!” exclaimed
Tom. “Patsy Donnelly told me you went
out with Sandy McCulloch while I was up
at the stables; an’ I went way home, an’
Mommie said you hadn’t been there, an’ I
came back to find you, an’ I went up to
your door an’ you wasn’t there, an’ I called
an’ called, an’ couldn’t hear no answer; an’
then I thought maybe you’d tried to come
out alone, an’ got off in the cross headin’
an’ got lost, an’”&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom stopped from sheer lack of breath,
and Bennie sobbed out,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did, I did get lost an’ scared, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;O
Tom, it was awful!”</p>

<p>The thought of what he had experienced
unnerved Bennie again, and, still
holding Tom’s hand, he sat down on the
floor of the mine and wept aloud.</p>

<p>“There, Bennie, don’t cry!” said Tom,
soothingly; “don’t cry! You’re found
now. Come, jump up an’ le’s go home;
Mommie’ll be half-crazy.” It was touching
to see the motherly way in which this boy
of fourteen consoled and comforted his
weaker brother, and helped him again to
his feet. With his arm around the blind
boy’s waist, Tom led him down, through
the chambers, out into the south heading,
and so to the foot of the slope.</p>

<p>It was not a great distance; Bennie’s
progress had been so slow that, although
he had, as he feared, wandered off by the
cross heading into the southern part of
the mine, he had not been able to get very
far away.</p>

<p>At the foot of the slope they stopped to
rest, and Bennie told about the strange
man who had talked with him at the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Tom could give no explanation of
the matter, except that the man must have
been one of the strikers. The meaning
of his strange conduct he could no more
understand than could Bennie.</p>

<p>It was a long way up the slope, and for
more than half the distance it was very
steep; like climbing up a ladder. Many
times on the upward way the boys stopped
to rest. Always when he heard Bennie’s
breathing grow hard and laborious, Tom
would complain of being himself tired, and
they would turn about and sit for a few
moments on a tie, facing down the slope.</p>

<p>Out at last into the quiet autumn night!
Bennie breathed a long sigh of relief when
he felt the yielding soil under his feet and
the fresh air in his face.</p>

<p>Ah! could he but have seen the village
lights below him, the glory of the sky and
the jewelry of stars above him, and the
half moon slipping up into the heavens
from its hiding-place beyond the heights of
Campbell’s Ledge, he would, indeed, have
known how sweet and beautiful the upper
earth is, even with the veil of night across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it, compared with the black recesses of the
mine.</p>

<p>It was fully a mile to the boys’ home;
but, with light hearts and willing feet, they
soon left the distance behind them, and
reached the low-roofed cottage, where the
anxious mother waited in hope and fear
for the coming of her children.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Mommie!” shouted
Tom, as he came around the corner and
saw her standing on the doorstep in the
moonlight watching. Out into the road
she ran then, and gathered her two boys
into her arms, kissed their grimy, coal-blackened
faces, and listened to their oft-interrupted
story, with smiles and with
tears, as she led them to her house.</p>

<p>But Tom stopped at the door and turned
back.</p>

<p>“I promised Sandy McCulloch,” he said,
“to go over an’ tell him if I found Bennie.
He said he’d wait up for me, an’ go an’
help me hunt him up if I came back without
him. It’s only just over beyond the
breaker; it won’t take twenty minutes,
an’ Sandy’ll be expectin’ me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>And without waiting for more words,
the boy started off on a run.</p>

<p>It was already past ten o’clock, and he
had not had a mouthful of supper, but
that was nothing in consideration of the
fact that Sandy had been good to him, and
would have helped him, and was, even
now, waiting for him. So, with a light
and grateful heart, he hurried on.</p>

<p>He passed beyond the little row of cottages,
of which his mother’s was one, over
the hill by a foot-path, and then along the
mine car-track to the breaker. Before
him the great building loomed up, like
some huge castle of old, cutting its outlines
sharply against the moon-illumined
sky, and throwing a broad black shadow
for hundreds of feet to the west.</p>

<p>Through the shadow went Tom, around
by the engine-room, where the watchman’s
light was glimmering faintly through the
grimy window; out again into the moonlight,
up, by a foot-path, to the summit of
another hill, along by another row of darkened
dwellings, to a cottage where a light
was still burning, and there he stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened before he reached it,
and a man in shirt-sleeves stepped out and
hailed him:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Tom? An’ did ye find
Bennie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sandy. I came to tell you we
just got home. Found him down in the
south chambers; he tried to come out
alone, an’ got lost. So I’ll not need you,
Sandy, with the same thanks as if I did,
an’ good-night to you!”</p>

<p>“Good-nicht till ye, Tom! I’m glad the
lad’s safe wi’ the mither. Tom,” as the
boy turned away, “ye’ll not be afeard to
be goin’ home alone?”</p>

<p>Tom laughed.</p>

<p>“Do I looked scared, Sandy? Give
yourself no fear for me; I’m afraid o’
naught.”</p>

<p>Before Sandy turned in at his door,
Tom had disappeared below the brow of
the hill. The loose gravel rolled under
his feet as he hurried down, and once,
near the bottom, he slipped and fell.</p>

<p>As he rose, he was astonished to see the
figure of a man steal carefully along in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the shadow of the breaker, and disappear
around the corner by the engine-room.</p>

<p>Tom went down cautiously into the
shadow, and stopped for a moment in the
track by the loading-place to listen. He
thought he heard a noise in there; something
that sounded like the snapping of
dry twigs.</p>

<p>The next moment a man came out from
under that portion of the breaker, with his
head turned back over his shoulder, muttering,
as he advanced toward Tom,&mdash;</p>

<p>“There, Mike, that’s the last job o’ that
kind I’ll do for all the secret orders i’ the
warl’. They put it on to me because I’ve
got no wife nor childer, nor ither body to
cry their eyes oot, an’ I get i’ the prison
for it. But I’ve had the hert o’ me touched
the day, Mike, an’ I canna do the like o’
this again; it’s the las’ time, min’ ye, the
las’ time I&mdash;Mike!&mdash;why, that’s no’
Mike! Don’t ye speak, lad! don’t ye
whusper! don’t ye stir!”</p>

<p>The man stepped forward, a very giant
in size, with a great beard floating on his
breast, and laid his brawny hands on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Tom’s shoulders with a grip that made
the lad wince.</p>

<p>Tom did not stir; he was too much
frightened for one thing, too much astonished
for another. For, before the man
had finished speaking, there appeared under
the loading-place in the breaker a little
flickering light, and the light grew into
a flame, and the flame curled around the
coal-black timbers, and sent up little red
tongues to lick the cornice of the long,
low roof. Tom was so astounded that he
could not speak, even if he had dared.
But this giant was standing over him,
gripping his shoulders in a painful clutch,
and saying to him, in a voice of emphasis
and determination,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do ye see me, lad? Do ye hear me?
Then I say to ye, tell a single soul what
ye’ve seen here the night, an’ the life
o’ ye’s not worth the dust i’ the road.
Whusper a single word o’ it, an’ the Molly
Maguires ’ll tak’ terrible revenge o’ ye’!
Noo, then, to your home! Rin! an’ gin
ye turn your head or speak, ye s’all wish
ye’d ’a’ been i’ the midst o’ the fire instead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>With a vigorous push, he sent Tom from
him at full speed down the track.</p>

<p>But the boy had not gone far before the
curiosity that overtook Lot’s wife came
upon him, and he turned and looked. He
was just in time to see and hear the sleepy
watchman open the door of the engine-room,
run out, give one startled look at
the flames as they went creeping up the
long slant of roof, and then make the still
night echo with his cry of “Fire!”</p>

<p>Before twenty minutes had passed, the
surrounding hills were alive with people
who had come to look upon the burning
breaker.</p>

<p>The spectacle was a grand one.</p>

<p>For many minutes the fire played about
in the lower part of the building, among
the pockets and the screens, and dashed
up against the base of the shaft-tower like
lapping waves. Then the small square
windows, dotting the black surface of the
breaker here and there up its seventy feet
of height, began to redden and to glow
with the mounting flames behind them;
a column of white smoke broke from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
topmost cornice, little red tongues went
creeping up to the very pinnacle of the
tower, and then from the highest point of
all a great column of fire shot far up toward
the onlooking stars, and the whole
gigantic building was a single body of
roaring, wavering flame.</p>

<p>It burned rapidly and brilliantly, and
soon after midnight there was but a mass
of charred ruins covering the ground where
once the breaker stood.</p>

<p>There was little that could be saved;
the cars in the loading-place, the tools
in the engine-room, some loose lumber,
and the household effects from a small
dwelling-house near by; that was all. But
among the many men who helped to save
this little, none labored with such energetic
effort, such daring zeal, such superhuman
strength, as the huge-framed, big-bearded
man they called Jack Rennie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The strike had become general. The
streets of the mining towns were filled with
idle, loitering men and boys. The drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
saloons drove a brisk business, and the
merchants feared disaster. Tom had not
told any one as yet of his adventure at the
breaker on the night of the fire. He knew
that he ought to disclose his secret; indeed,
he felt a pressing duty upon him to
do so in order that the crime might be
duly punished. But the secret order of
Molly Maguires was a terror in the coal
regions in those days; the torch, the pistol,
and the knife were the instruments with
which it carried out its desperate decrees,
and Tom was absolutely afraid to whisper
a word of what he knew, even to his
mother or to Bennie.</p>

<p>But one day the news went out that
Jack Rennie had been arrested, charged
with setting fire to the Valley Breaker;
and soon afterward a messenger came to
the house of the Widow Taylor, saying that
Tom was wanted immediately in Wilkesbarre
at the office of Lawyer Pleadwell.</p>

<p>Tom answered this summons gladly, as
it might possibly afford a means by which
he would be compelled to tell what he
knew about the fire, with the least responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
resting on him for the disclosure.
But he resolved that, in no event, would
he speak any thing but the truth.</p>

<p>After he was dressed and brushed to the
satisfaction of his careful mother, Tom
went with the messenger to the railroad
station, and the fast train soon brought
them into the city of Wilkesbarre, the
county town of Luzerne County.</p>

<p>On one of the streets radiating from
the court-house square, they stopped before
a dingy-looking door on which was
fastened a sign reading: “James G. Pleadwell,
Attorney-at-Law.”</p>

<p>Tom was taken, first, into the outer
room of the law-offices, where a man sat
at a table writing, and two or three other
men, evidently miners, were talking together
in a corner; and then, after a few
moments, the door into an inner apartment
was opened and he was called in
there. This room was more completely
furnished than the outer one; there was
a carpet on the floor, and there were pictures
on the walls; also there were long
shelves full of books, all bound alike in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
leather, all with red labels near the tops
and black labels near the bottoms of their
backs.</p>

<p>At the farther side of the room sat a
short, slim, beardless man, with pale face
and restless eyes, whom Tom recognized
as having been in the mine with the visiting
strikers the day Bennie was lost; and
by a round centre table sat Lawyer Pleadwell,
short and stout, with bristly mustache
and a stubby nose on which rested a
pair of gold-rimmed eye-glasses.</p>

<p>As Tom entered the room, the lawyer
regarded him closely, and waving his hand
towards an easy chair, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be seated, my lad. Your name is&mdash;a’&mdash;let
me see”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tom&mdash;Thomas Taylor, sir,” answered
the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, you saw the fire at the
Valley Breaker?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tom; “I guess I was
the first one ’at saw it.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard,” said the lawyer,
slowly; then, after a pause,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tom have you told to any one what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you saw, or whom you saw at the moment
of the breaking out of that fire?”</p>

<p>“I have not, sir,” answered Tom, wondering
how the lawyer knew he had seen
any one.</p>

<p>“Do you expect, or desire, to disclose
your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Tom; “I ought to a’ told
before; I meant to a’ told, but I didn’t
dare. I’d like to tell now.”</p>

<p>Tom was growing bold; he felt that he
had kept the secret long enough and that,
now, it must out.</p>

<p>Lawyer Pleadwell twirled his glasses
thoughtfully for a few moments, then
placed them deliberately on his nose, and
turned straight to Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom,” he said, “we may as well
be plain with you. I represent Jack
Rennie, who is charged with firing this
breaker, and Mr. Carolan here is officially
connected with the order of Molly Maguires,
in pursuance of whose decree the
deed is supposed to have been done. We
have known, for some time, that a boy was
present when the breaker was fired. Last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
night we learned that you were that boy.
Now, what we want of you is simply this:
to keep your knowledge to yourself. This
will be to your own advantage as well as
for the benefit of others. Will you do
it?”</p>

<p>To Tom, the case had taken on a new
aspect. Instead of being, as he had supposed,
in communication with those who
desired to punish the perpetrators of the
crime, he found himself in the hands of
the prisoner’s friends. But his Scotch
stubbornness came to the rescue, and he
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, sir; it wasn’t right to burn
the breaker, an’ the man ’at done it ought
to go to jail for it.”</p>

<p>Lawyer Pleadwell inserted a thumb into
the arm-hole of his vest, and poised his
glasses carefully in his free hand. He was
preparing to argue the case with Tom.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said he, “you were a miner,
as you hope to be, as your father was before
you; and a brutal and soulless corporation,
having reduced your wages to
the starvation-point, while its vaults were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
gorged with money, should kick you, like
a dog, out of their employ, when you
humbly asked them for enough to keep
body and soul together. Suppose you
knew that the laws were made for the rich
and against the poor, as they are, and that
your only redress, and a speedy one, would
be to spoil the property of your persecutors
till they came to treat you like a
human being, with rights to be respected,
as they surely would, for they fear nothing
so much as the torch; would you think it
right for a fellow-workman to deliver you
up to their vengeance and fury for having
taught them such a lesson?”</p>

<p>The lawyer placed his glasses on his
nose, and leaned forward, eagerly, towards
Tom.</p>

<p>The argument was not without its effect.
Tom had long been led to believe that corporations
were tyrannical monsters. But
the boy’s inherent sense of right and
wrong was proof against even this specious
plea.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he said, “I can’t make
out ’at it’s right to burn a breaker. Why,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he continued, “you might say the same
thing if it’d ’a been murder.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell saw that he was on the wrong
track with this clear-headed boy.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, settling back in his
chair, “if peaceful persuasion will not
avail, I trust you are prepared, in case of
disclosure, to meet whatever the Molly
Maguires have in store for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tom, boldly, “I am.
I’ve been afraid of ’em, an’ that’s what’s
kept me from tellin’; but I won’t be a
coward any more; they can do what they’re
a mind to with me.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was in a quandary, and Carolan
shot angry glances at Tom. Here
was a lad who held Jack Rennie’s fate in
his hands, and whom neither fear nor persuasion
could move. What was to be
done?</p>

<p>Pleadwell motioned to Carolan, and
they rose and left the room together;
while Tom sat, with tumultuously beating
heart, but with constantly increasing resolution.</p>

<p>The men were gone but a few moments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and came back with satisfied looks on their
faces.</p>

<p>“I have learned,” said the lawyer, addressing
Tom, in a voice laden with apparent
sympathy, “that you have a younger
brother who is blind. That is a sad affliction.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed it is,” replied Tom; “yes,
indeed!”</p>

<p>“I have learned, also, that there is a
possibility of cure, if the eyes are subjected
to proper and timely treatment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what a doctor told us.”</p>

<p>“What a blessing it would be if sight
could be restored to him! what a delight!
What rejoicing there would be in your
little household, would there not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed there would!” cried Tom,
“oh, indeed! It’s what we’re a-thinkin’ of
al’ays; it’s what I pray for every night,
sir. We’ve been a-tryin’ to save money
enough to do it, but it’s slow a-gettin’ it,
it’s awful slow.”</p>

<p>“A&mdash;how much”&mdash;Lawyer Pleadwell
paused, and twirled his eye-glasses thoughtfully&mdash;“how
much would it cost, Tom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only a hundred dollars, sir; that’s
what the doctor said.”</p>

<p>Another pause; then, with great deliberation,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tom, suppose my friend here should
see fit to place in your hands, to-day, the
sum of one hundred dollars, to be used in
your brother’s behalf; could you return the
favor by keeping to yourself the knowledge
you possess concerning the origin of the
fire at the breaker?”</p>

<p>The hot blood surged up into Tom’s
face, his heart pounded like a hammer
against his breast, his head was in a whirl.</p>

<p>A hundred dollars! and sight for Bennie!
No lies to be told&mdash;only to keep
quiet&mdash;and sight for Bennie! Would it
be very wrong? But, oh, to think of Bennie
in the joy of seeing! The temptation
was terrible. Stronger, less affectionate
natures than Tom’s might well have
yielded.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>THE UNQUIET CONSCIENCE.</small></h2>


<p>And Tom yielded.</p>

<p>The whisperings of conscience were
drowned in the anticipation of Bennie’s
joy. The fear of personal violence would
not have conquered him; neither would
the fallacious argument of compensation by
destruction have done so. But that vision
of Bennie, with eyes that could look into
his eyes, with eyes that could see the
houses and the breakers, the trees and the
birds and the flowers, that could even see
the far-off stars in the sky at night,&mdash;that
was the vision that crowded out from
Tom’s mind the sharp distinction between
right and wrong, and delivered him over
wholly to the tempter.</p>

<p>But he felt the shame of it, nevertheless,
as he answered, in a choking voice, at
last,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I could. A hundred dollars ’d
give sight to Bennie. I wouldn’t lie for it,
but I’ll keep still for it.”</p>

<p>Lawyer Pleadwell doubled up his glasses,
slipped them into a morocco case, and
slipped the case into his vest-pocket. His
object was accomplished.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said, “you’re a wise lad. If
you keep on in this way, you’ll make a
lawyer; and a lawyer, with so evenly
balanced a conscience as yours, will be a
credit to the profession.”</p>

<p>Tom was not quite sure whether this was
intended for a compliment or not, so he
simply said, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell reached across the table for
his high silk hat, motioned to Carolan to
follow him, and went out, saying to Tom
as he went,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You stay here and amuse yourself;
we’ll be back shortly.”</p>

<p>Tom sat there alone quite still. His
mind was in a tumult. Is it right? Is
it <em>right</em>? Some unseen presence kept
crowding the question in upon him.</p>

<p>What would Bennie say to it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>What would Mommie say to it?</p>

<p>Yet there were no lies to be told; he
was simply to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>But was it not shielding a criminal from
just punishment? Was it not virtually
selling his honor for money? Would it
not be better, after all, to take back his
promise, to do his duty fearlessly, and to
work and wait, patiently and with a clear
conscience, for means to accomplish the
desire of his heart for Bennie?</p>

<p>He was just getting into a state of painful
indecision when Carolan came in alone,
and closed the door carefully behind him.
Without saying a word, he handed to Tom,
one by one, ten crisp, new ten-dollar bills.
The boy had never in his life before seen
so much money at one time. To hold it
was like a scene in a fairy story; to own it
was to be rich beyond belief. The whispers
of conscience were again stilled in the
novelty of possessing wealth with which
such blessings might be bought.</p>

<p>Tom took the money, folded it awkwardly,
and placed it in the inside pocket
of his vest. Carolan looked on with apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
satisfaction; then went and seated
himself in the chair he had formerly occupied,
without having uttered a word.</p>

<p>This man was a marked character in the
anthracite coal region twenty years ago.
He was known among the miners as
“Silent Mike,” was credited with much
native ability and sharpness, and was generally
believed to be at the head, in the
anthracite region, of the secret order of
Molly Maguires. He was always shrewd
enough not to implicate himself in any
lawlessness. The fact that he so controlled
the organization as to meet his personal
ends caused it, eventually, to be split with
internal dissensions. Then, as a new reign
of law and order came in, and as organized
labor began to base itself on higher principles,
and to work out its problem with less
of vengeance and more of justice, the
order gradually passed out of existence.</p>

<p>Thinking there was nothing more to be
said or done, Tom rose to go; but just
then Pleadwell entered, laid his silk hat
carefully on the table, and motioned to him
to be seated. Having taken his eye-glasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from their case and adjusted them carefully
on his nose, he said to Tom,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It will not be wise for you to make
any large expenditures of money for any
purpose until after the trial; and in the
mean time it will be absolutely unsafe for
you to disclose to any one the fact of your
having money or the means by which it
was obtained. Your own discretion will
teach you this. You understand me, do
you not?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and Pleadwell continued:</p>

<p>“There is one thing more that I desire
to speak of: I have heard that when you
reached the foot of the hill on the night
the breaker was burned, you saw a man
come from near the point where the fire
broke out, pass by you in the shadow of the
building, and disappear around the corner
by the engine-room. Is this true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a looking man was this?
Describe him.”</p>

<p>“He was a short man,” Tom replied,
“kind o’ slim, an’ he didn’t have any
whiskers”&mdash;a sudden thought seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to strike the boy, and looking for a
moment earnestly at Carolan, and then
pointing his finger at him, he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, he looked just like&mdash;just like
him!”</p>

<p>Carolan smiled grimly, but Pleadwell
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom,” he said, “we shall not ask
you to tell whom he looks like, but if I
should require your presence at the trial,
and should call you to the witness-stand,
you would have no objection, I presume,
to giving a description of the man you saw
pass by you in the shadow of the breaker,
just as you have described him to me?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Tom, “not so long as it’s
true.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should expect you to say nothing
that is not strictly true,” said Pleadwell.
“I would not allow a witness of mine to
tell a lie. Well, then, you are to be in the
court-room here a week from next Tuesday
morning at nine o’clock. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Carolan, put Thomas Taylor’s name on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that subpœna. You will consider yourself
subpœnaed, Tom. Now,” taking a heavy
gold watch from his fob-pocket and glancing
at it, “you will have just time to catch
the train north.” Then stepping to the
door between the two rooms, and throwing
it open, he said, “Harris, go to the station
with this boy, buy his ticket, and see that
he gets the right train.”</p>

<p>Harris was the young man who came
down with Tom, and he and the boy were
soon on the street together, walking briskly
toward the station.</p>

<p>An hour earlier, when they were coming
in, Tom had been very talkative and inquiring,
but now his companion was able
to get from him no more than a simple
“yes” or “no,” and that only in answer to
questions.</p>

<p>Conversation was impossible to the boy,
with his mind so crowded with perplexing
doubts. He could not even take notice
of the shop-windows, or of the life in the
streets, but followed blindly along by
the side of Harris. Somehow he felt as
though he were walking under a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
weight, and that roll of money in his
pocket seemed to be burning him where
it rested against his breast. He imagined
that the people he met looked at him suspiciously,
as if they knew he had been
bribed&mdash;<em>bribed</em>!</p>

<p>The word came into his mind so suddenly,
and with such startling force, that he
stopped still in the street, and only recovered
himself when Harris turned and called
to him.</p>

<p>They were just in time for the train.</p>

<p>Tom found a place in the corner of the
car where he would be alone, and sat there
thinking over what he had done, and trying
to reason himself into justification of
his conduct.</p>

<p>The conductor came along and punched
his ticket, and looked at him so sharply
that Tom wondered if he knew. But of
course that was absurd. Then he tried
to dismiss the matter from his mind altogether,
and give his attention to what he
could see from the car-window.</p>

<p>Outside a drizzling rain was beginning
to fall on the brown fields and leafless trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the autumn early twilight was fast
deepening into darkness. It was very
dismal and cheerless, and not at all the
kind of outlook that could serve to draw
Tom’s mind from its task of self-contemplation.
It was but a few minutes, therefore,
before this controversy with himself
was going on again, harder than
before.</p>

<p>Somehow that strange word “bribed”
kept haunting him. It sounded constantly
in his ears. He imagined that the people
in the cars were speaking it; that even the
rhythmic rattle of the wheels upon the rails
kept singing it to him with monotonous
reiteration, “Bribed! <em>bribed</em>!”</p>

<p>Tom thought, as he hurried down the
street in the gathering darkness, out upon
the plank walk, and up the long hill toward
home, that he had never been so unhappy
in all his life before. It was strange, too,
for he had so often dreamed of the great
joy he should feel when the coveted hundred
dollars had been saved.</p>

<p>Well, he had it now, every cent of it,
rolled up and tucked safely away in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pocket of his vest; but instead of happiness,
it had brought misery.</p>

<p>For the first time within his memory, the
thought of meeting his mother and his
brother gave him no pleasure. He would
not tell them about the money that night
at any rate; he had decided upon that.
Indeed, he had almost concluded that it
would be better that they should not know
about it until after the trial. And then
suppose they should not approve! He
was aghast at the very thought.</p>

<p>But Tom was a brave lad, and he put on
a bright face before these two, and told
them of his trip to Wilkesbarre, and about
what he had seen and heard,&mdash;about the
law-office, about Pleadwell and Carolan,
about every thing, indeed, but the bargain
and the money.</p>

<p>He tried to eat his supper as if he enjoyed
it, though every mouthful seemed
about to choke him, and on the plea of
being very tired, he went early to bed.
There he lay half the night debating with
his conscience, trying to make himself believe
that he had done right, yet feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
all the time that he had stooped to dishonor.</p>

<p>He went over in his mind the way in
which he should break the news to Mommie
and Bennie, and wondered how they would
receive it; and always beating upon his
brain, with a regular cadence that followed
the pulsation of his heart, and with a monotonous
rhythm that haunted him even
after he had fallen into a troubled sleep,
went that terrible word, <em>Bribed</em>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The autumn days went by, and still the
strike continued. There were no signs of
resumption, no signs of compromise. On
the contrary, the breach between the miners
and the operators was growing daily wider.
The burning of the Valley breaker and the
arrest of Jack Rennie had given rise to
a bitterness of feeling between the two
classes that hindered greatly an amicable
settlement of their differences.</p>

<p>Acts of lawlessness were common, and
it was apparent that but little provocation
would be needed to bring on deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
violence of a desperate nature. The cry
of want began to be heard, and, as the
winter season was drawing near, suffering
became more frequent among the improvident
and the unfortunate.</p>

<p>The Taylor family saw coming the time
when the pittance of twenty dollars that
the boys had saved for Bennie must be
drawn upon to furnish food and clothing
for them all. Tom had tried to get work
outside of the mines, but had failed; there
were so many idle men and boys, and
there was so little work to be done at that
season of the year. But the district school
was open, not far from his home, and Tom
went there instead.</p>

<p>He was fond of books, and had studied
much by himself. He could read very well
indeed. He used to read aloud to Bennie
a great deal, and during these days of
enforced idleness the boys occupied much
of their time in that way; finding their
literature in copies of old newspapers
which had been given to them, and in a
few old books which had belonged to their
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Indian Summer came late that year, but
it was very fair. It lingered day after day,
with its still air, its far-sounding echoes, its
hazy light and its smoky distances; and
the brooding spirit of nature’s quiet rested
down, for a brief but beautiful season,
about the unquiet spirits of men.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of one of its most
charming days, Tom and Bennie sauntered
out, hand in hand, as they always went, to
where the hill, south of their little mining
village, rose like a huge, upturned bowl,
sloping downward from its summit to every
point of the compass. Over in the little
valley to the south lay the ruins of the
burned breaker, still untouched; and off
upon the other side, one could see the
sparkling Susquehanna far up into the narrow
valley where its waters sweep around
the base of Campbell’s Ledge; across to
the blue mountains on the west; and down
the famous valley of Wyoming, with its
gray stone monument in the middle distance,
until the eastern hills crept in to
intercept the view.</p>

<p>It was a dreamy day, and a day fit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
dreams, and when the boys reached the
summit of the hill, Tom lay down upon
the warm sod, and silently looked away to
the haze-wrapped mountains, while Bennie
sat by his side, and pictured to his mind
the view before him, as Tom had described
it to him many times, sitting in that very
spot.</p>

<p>Poor Tom! These beautiful days had
brought to him much perplexity of mind,
much futile reasoning with his conscience,
and much, very much, of silent suffering.</p>

<p>Lying there now, in the sunlight, with
open eyes, he saw, in reality, no more of
the beautiful scene before him than did
blind Bennie at his side. He was thinking
of the trial, now only three days distant,
of what he should be called upon to do
and to say, and of how, after it was all
over, he must tell Mommie and Bennie
about the hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Ah, there was the trouble! he could see
his way clearly enough until it should come
to that; but how should he ever be able to
tell to these two a thing of which he tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to be proud, but of which, after all, he felt
guilty and ashamed?</p>

<p>Then, what would they say to him?
Would they praise him for his devotion to
Bennie, and for his cleverness in having
grasped an opportunity? Or would they
grieve over his lack of manly firmness and
his loss of boyish honor? Alas! the more
he thought of it, the more he feared that
they would sorrow rather than rejoice.</p>

<p>But an idea came to Tom, as he lay
there, thinking the matter over; the idea
that perhaps he could learn what Bennie’s
mind would be on the subject, without
exciting any suspicion therein of what had
actually occurred. He resolved to try.</p>

<p>He hardly knew how best to approach
the matter, but, after some consideration,
he turned to Bennie and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bennie, do you s’pose Jack Rennie
act’ally set fire to that breaker?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit, Tom,” replied
Bennie; “those ’at know, him says he’s
dreadful bad. ’Taint so much worse to
burn a breaker than ’tis to burn a shaft-house,
an’ they say he act’ally did burn a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shaft-house up at Hyde Park, only they
couldn’t prove it on him.”</p>

<p>“Well, s’pose you’d ’a’ seen&mdash;s’pose you
could see, you know, Bennie&mdash;an’ s’pose
you’d ’a’ seen Jack Rennie set fire to that
breaker; would you tell on him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” said Bennie, resolutely,
“if I thought he’d never get punished for
it ’less I did tell on him.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think,” continued Tom,
reflectively, “’at that’d be sidin’ with the
wealthy <em>clapitulist</em>, against the poor laborer,
who ain’t got no other way to get even
justice for himself, except to make the rich
<em>corpurations</em> afraid of him, that way?”</p>

<p>Tom was using Pleadwell’s argument,
not because he believed in it himself,
but simply to see how Bennie would
meet it.</p>

<p>Bennie met it by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care; I don’t b’lieve it’s
<em>ever</em> right to burn up any thing ’at belongs
to anybody else; an’ if I saw any one
a-doin’ it, I’d tell on him if”&mdash;Bennie
hesitated a moment, and Tom looked up
eagerly&mdash;“if I wasn’t afraid o’ the Molly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Maguires. Jack Rennie’s a Molly, you
know.”</p>

<p>“But <em>wouldn’t</em> you be afraid of ’em?
s’pose one of ’em should come to you an’
say, ‘Ben Taylor, if you tell on Jack, we’ll
put out your’&mdash;I mean ‘cut off your
tongue.’ What’d you do?”</p>

<p>Bennie thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, I b’lieve I’d tell on him, anyway;
an’ then I’d get a pistol, an’ I wouldn’t let
no Molly get nearer to me’n the muzzle of
it.”</p>

<p>In spite of his great anxiety, Tom laughed
at the picture of weak, blind little Bennie
holding a crowd of outlaws at bay, with a
cocked revolver in his hand. But he felt
that he was not getting at the real question
very fast, so he tried again.</p>

<p>“Well, Bennie, s’pose you’d ’a’ seen
him start that fire, an’ he’d ’a’ knowed it,
an’ he’d ’a’ said to you, ‘Ben Taylor, if you
ever tell on me, I’ll burn your Mommie’s
house down, an’ I’ll most kill your brother
Tom!’ <em>then</em> what’d you do?”</p>

<p>Bennie hesitated. This was more of a
poser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” he answered, at last, “if I’d ’a’
b’lieved he’d ’a’ done what he said&mdash;I
don’t know&mdash;I guess I’d&mdash;well, maybe, if
I didn’t have to tell any lie, I just wouldn’t
say any thing.”</p>

<p>Tom’s spirits rose; he felt that a great
point was gained. Here was a matter in
which Bennie would have been even less
firm than he himself had been. Now was
the time to come directly to the issue, to
ask the final question.</p>

<p>Tom braced himself to the task. He
tried to speak naturally and carelessly, but
there was a strange shortness of breath,
and a huskiness in his voice which he
could not control; he could only hope that
Bennie would not notice it.</p>

<p>“Well, then, s’pose&mdash;just s’pose, you
know&mdash;that <em>I’d</em> seen Jack Rennie set fire
to the breaker, an’ ’at he knew I was goin’
to tell on him, an’ ’at he’d ’a’ said to me,
‘Tom, you got a blind brother Bennie, ain’t
you?’ an’ I’d ’a’ said, ‘Yes,’ an’ he’d ’a’ said,
‘What’ll it cost to get Bennie’s sight for
him?’ an’ I’d ’a’ said, ‘Oh, maybe a hundred
dollars,’ an’ he’d ’a’ said, ‘Here, Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
here’s a hundred dollars; you go an’ get
Bennie’s eyes cured; an’ don’t you say
any thin’ about my settin’ that fire.’ What&mdash;what’d
you ’a’ done if you’d ’a’ been
me?”</p>

<p>Tom raised himself to a sitting posture,
and leaned toward Bennie, with flushed face
and painful expectancy in his eyes.</p>

<p>He knew that for him Bennie’s answer
meant either a return to a measure of the
old happiness, or a plunging into deeper
misery.</p>

<p>The blind boy rose to his feet and stood
for a moment as if lost in thought. Then
he turned his sightless eyes to Tom, and
said, very slowly and distinctly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you’d ’a’ took it, Tom, an’ if you’d
’a’ used it to cure me with, an’ I’d ’a’ known
it, an’ I’d ’a’ got my sight, I don’t believe&mdash;I
don’t believe I should ever ’a’ wanted
to look at you, Tom, or wanted you to see
me; I’d ’a’ been so ’shamed o’ both of us.”</p>

<small>THE TRIAL.</small></h2>


<p>Tom turned his head away, and covered
his face with his hands. This was cruel.
For the first time in his life, he was glad
Bennie could not see him. But he felt
that it was necessary for him to say something,
so he stammered out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, I was only just s’posin’, you
know. Course, no honest fellow’d do that;
but if they’ll only get to work again, we
won’t ask anybody for any hunderd dollars.
We’ll earn it.”</p>

<p>The beauty of the autumn day died
slowly out, and the narrow crescent of the
new moon, hanging over the tops of the far
western hills, shone dimly through the
purple haze. Sadly and with few words
the two boys went their homeward way.
A great burden of regret and remorse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
rested upon Tom’s heart, and the shadow
of it fell upon the heart of his blind
brother.</p>

<p>Poor, poor Tom! He knew not what to
do. He could never use the money now for
Bennie, and he would not use it for himself.
It had occurred to him once to take
the money back to Pleadwell, and seek to
be released from his agreement. But a
little thought had convinced him that this
would be useless; that the money would
not be received; that, having accepted a
bribe, he had placed himself in the power
of those who had given it to him, and that
any wavering on his part, much more any
violation of his agreement, would bring
down vengeance and punishment on himself,
and trouble and disgrace on those who
were dear to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, why,” he asked himself, in bitter
thought, “why did I ever take the money?”</p>

<p>Tom’s mother attributed his melancholy
to lack of work and loss of earnings. She
knew how his heart was set on laying up
money to send Bennie away, and how impatient
he became at any delay in the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of his scheme. So she talked to him
very cheerfully, and made delicate little
dishes to tempt his appetite, and when the
morning for the trial came, and Tom started
for the train to go to Wilkesbarre, dressed
in his best clothes, and with the hated
hundred dollars burning in his pocket, she
kissed him good-by with a smile on her
face. She bade him many times to be very
careful about the cars, and said to him, at
parting, “Whatever tha says to thee, lad,
tell the truth; whatever tha does to thee,
tell the truth; fear to look no man i’ the
eye; be good an’ honest wi’ yoursel’, an’
coom back to Mommie an’ Bennie, when
it’s ower, hearty an’ weel.”</p>

<p>Sandy McCulloch went down with Tom
on the train, and together they walked from
the station to the Court House. There
were many people standing about in the
Court-House Square, and in the corridors
of the building, and the court-room itself
was nearly full when Tom and Sandy entered
it. They found vacant places on
one of the rear benches, but, as the seats
were all graded down on a sloping floor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the bar, they could see without difficulty all
that was being done.</p>

<p>Tom had never been in a court-room
before, and he looked with much interest
at the judges on the bench, at the lawyers
chatting pleasantly in the bar, at the entry
and departure of the grand jury, and at
the officious constables, each with his staff
of office, who kept order in the court-room.</p>

<p>There were some motions and arguments
which Tom could not understand,
being made by the attorneys; the clerk
read some lists in a weak voice, and the
time of the court was thus occupied until
toward noon.</p>

<p>By and by there was a slight bustle at
the side door, to the right of the judges’
bench, and the sheriff and his deputy entered
with Jack Rennie.</p>

<p>Head and shoulders above those who
accompanied him, his heavily bearded face
somewhat pale from confinement, and
stooping rather more than usual, he moved
slowly across the crowded bar, in full view
of all the people in the room, to a seat by
the side of his counsel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The instant Tom’s eyes rested on him
he recognized him as the man who had
threatened him at the breaker on the night
of the fire. The buzz of excitement, occasioned
by the entrance of the prisoner,
subsided, and the voice of the presiding
judge sounded distinctly through the
room:</p>

<p>“Commonwealth against Jack Rennie.
Arson. Are you ready for trial?”</p>

<p>“We are, your Honor,” replied the
district attorney, rising to his feet and
advancing to the clerk’s desk.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the judge. “Arraign
the prisoner.”</p>

<p>Rennie was directed to stand up, and
the district attorney read, in a clear voice,
the indictment, which charged that the
defendant “did, on the eighteenth day of
November last passed, feloniously, wilfully
and maliciously set fire to, burn and
consume, a certain building, to wit: a coal-breaker,
the same being the property of a
certain body corporate known by the style
and title of ‘The Valley Coal Company;’
by reason of which setting fire to, burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and consuming, a certain dwelling-house,
also the property of the said Valley Coal
Company, and being within the curtilage
of said coal-breaker, was also burned and
consumed; contrary to the form of the
act of the General Assembly, in such case
made and provided, and against the peace
and dignity of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>Rennie stood, listening intently to the
reading of the indictment. When the
question was put:</p>

<p>“What say you,&mdash;guilty, or not guilty?”
he replied, in a deep, chest voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“If I be guilty, ye ha’ but to prove it.”</p>

<p>“Make your plea, sir!” said the judge
severely. “Guilty, or not guilty?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll plead no’ guilty. No mon’s
guilty till he’s proved guilty.”</p>

<p>Rennie resumed his seat, and the court
was soon afterward adjourned for the noon
recess.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the selecting of jurors
in the case against Rennie began.</p>

<p>The first one called was a miner. One
could tell that by the blue powder-marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
on his face, and that he was of Irish nativity
could be detected by the rich brogue
that escaped his lips. He was “passed”
by the Commonwealth, and the clerk of the
court recited the formula:</p>

<p>“Juror, look upon the prisoner. Prisoner,
look upon the juror. What say
you,&mdash;challenge, or no challenge?”</p>

<p>“Swear the juror to ‘true answers
make,’” said Attorney Pleadwell.</p>

<p>The man was sworn.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” inquired the
lawyer.</p>

<p>“Up on Shanty Hill, sorr.”</p>

<p>“That’s definite. Anywhere near this
breaker that was burned?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the matther of a mile belike, barrin’
the time it’d take ye to walk to the
track beyant.”</p>

<p>“What’s your occupation?”</p>

<p>“Occupation, is it? Yis, sorr; as good
a char<em>rac</em>ter as anny”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean what do you work at?”</p>

<p>“I’m a miner, sorr.”</p>

<p>“Where do you work?”</p>

<p>“Faith, I worked for the Valley Breaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Coal Company this tin years come next
St. Patrick’s day, may it plase the coort,
an’ bad ’cess to the man that burnt it,
I say, an’”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Challenge!” interrupted Attorney
Pleadwell, sharply.</p>

<p>A tipstaff hurried the challenged man
from the witness-box, in a state of helpless
bewilderment as to what it all meant, and
another juror was called, a small, wiry man,
chewing on a mouthful of tobacco. He
was sworn on his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voir dire</i>, and the district
attorney asked him,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you belong to an organization
known as the Molly Maguires?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” quickly responded the man,
before Pleadwell could interpose an objection
to the question.</p>

<p>The district attorney looked at the witness
sharply for a moment, then consulted
with Attorney Summons, who sat by his
side as private counsel for the prosecution.
They believed that the man had sworn
falsely, in order to get on the jury in behalf
of the defendant, and he was directed to
stand aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The next juror called was a farmer from
a remote part of the county, who had heard
nothing about the fire until he arrived in
town, and who displayed no prejudices.
He was accepted by both sides as the first
juror in the case.</p>

<p>So the selection went on, slowly and
tediously, enlivened at times by an amusing
candidate for the jury-box, or a tilt between
counsel; and long before the “twelve good
men and true” had all been selected and
sworn, the early autumn night had fallen,
and the flaring gas-jets lighted up the
space about the bench and bar, leaving
the remote corners of the court-room in
uncertain shadow.</p>

<p>At six o’clock court was adjourned until
the following morning, and Tom went, with
Sandy McCulloch, to a small hotel on the
outskirts of the city, where arrangements
had been made to accommodate witnesses
for the defence. Notwithstanding
his anxiety of mind, Tom was hungry,
and he ate a hearty supper and went
early to bed.</p>

<p>But he could not sleep. The excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the day had left his brain in a whirl, and
he tossed restlessly about, going over in
his mind what had already occurred, and
thinking with grave apprehension of what
to-morrow might bring forth. Through it
all he still repeated one resolve: that whatever
came he would not lie.</p>

<p>With this unsatisfactory compromise with
his conscience on his mind, he fell at last
into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p>When court was opened on the following
morning, the court-room was more
densely crowded with idle men than it had
been on the previous day. The case against
Rennie was taken up without delay. The
district attorney made the opening address
on behalf of the Commonwealth, doing
little more than to outline the evidence to
be presented by the prosecution.</p>

<p>The first witness called was a civil engineer,
who presented a map showing the
plan, location and surroundings of the
burned breaker. Following him came two
witnesses who detailed the progress of the
fire as they had seen it, one of them being
the watchman at the breaker, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the occupant of the dwelling-house which
had been burned.</p>

<p>A third witness testified to having seen
Rennie at the fire shortly after it broke out,
but did not know how long he had been
there, nor where he came from; and still
another swore that he had seen the defendant
in a drinking-saloon in town, about
half an hour before he heard the alarm of
fire, and had noticed that he went away, in
the direction of the breaker, in company
with “Silent Mike.”</p>

<p>Then came a witness who gave his name
as Lewis G. Travers; a slightly built, but
muscular man, of middle age, with sharp
eyes and quiet manner.</p>

<p>“What is your occupation?” inquired
the district attorney, after the man had
been sworn.</p>

<p>“I am a detective.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Jack Rennie, the defendant?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Where did you last see him?”</p>

<p>“At a meeting, in Carbondale, of certain
members of the order of Molly Maguires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you a member of that order?”</p>

<p>“I have been.”</p>

<p>“Will you relate the circumstances attending
your connection with it?”</p>

<p>The stillness in the court-room was marvellous.
On many an expectant face were
mingled expressions of hate and fear, as
the witness, with calm deliberation, related
the thrilling story of how he had worked as
a common laborer in the mines, in order to
gain a standing with the lawless miners,
and of how he had then been admitted to
the order of Molly Maguires, and had
taken part in their deliberations.</p>

<p>As a member of the executive board, he
had been present, he said, at a secret meeting
held in Carbondale, at which, on account
of the outspoken denunciation of the
order, and the prompt dismissal of men belonging
to it, by the owners of the Valley
Breaker, it was resolved to visit them with
vengeance, in the shape of fire; that Jack
Rennie was selected to carry out the resolution,
and that Rennie, being present, had
registered a solemn oath to do the bidding
of the order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the substance of his testimony,
and though the cross-examination, by
Pleadwell, was sharp, rigid and severe, the
effect of the evidence could not be broken.</p>

<p>At this point the Commonwealth rested.
The case against Rennie had assumed a
serious phase. Unless he could produce
some strong evidence in his favor, his conviction
was almost assured.</p>

<p>Pleadwell rose to open the case for the
defence. After some general remarks on
the unfairness of the prosecution, and the
weakness of the detective’s story, he declared
that they should prove, in behalf of
the defendant, that he was not at or near
the breaker until after the fire was well
under way, and that the saving of a large
portion of the company’s loose property
from destruction was due to his brave and
energetic efforts.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” continued Pleadwell,
earnestly, “we shall present to the court
and jury a most irreproachable witness, who
will testify to you that he was present and
saw this fire kindled, and that the man who
kindled it was <em>not</em> Jack Rennie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a buzz of excitement in the
court-room as Pleadwell resumed his seat;
and Tom’s heart beat loudly as he understood
the significance of the lawyer’s last
statement. He felt, more than ever, the
wrong, the disgrace, the self-humiliation
to which he should stoop, by giving his
testimony in support of so monstrous a
lie.</p>

<p>But what could he do? The strain on
his mind was terrible. He felt an almost
irresistible desire to cry out, there, in the
crowded court-room, that he had yielded
to temptation for the sake of blind Bennie;
that he had seen the folly and the wickedness,
and known the awful misery of it
already; that the money that bought him
was like rags in his sight; and that his own
guilt and cowardice should save this criminal
no longer from the punishment which
his crime deserved.</p>

<p>By a strong effort, he repressed his
emotion, and sat, with face flushed and
pallid by turns, waiting for the time when
his wretched bargain should be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The first witness called on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the defence was Michael Carolan, better
known as “Silent Mike.”</p>

<p>He testified that Rennie came down
from Scranton with him and a body of
strikers on the morning of November 18;
that they ate supper with Carolan’s married
sister, who lived in the village, just
beyond the burned breaker; that they
spent the evening at a miners’ mass-meeting
in town, and afterwards called at a
drinking-saloon; and that they were on
the way back to his sister’s house, for the
night, when they heard the cry of “Fire!”</p>

<p>“At this time,” continued Carolan, “Jack
and me were together at the crossin’ on
Railroad Street, maybe a quarter of a mile
away from the breaker, an’ whin we heard
the alarm, we looked up the track an’ saw
the blaze, an’ Jack says, says he, ‘Mike, the
breaker’s a-fire,’ an’ I says, says I, ‘It is,
sure;’ an’ with that we both ran up the
track toward the fire.</p>

<p>“Whin we were most there we met
Sandy McCulloch comin’ from the hill
beyant, an’ me an’ him an’ Jack wint an’
shoved out the cars from the loadin’-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that we could get at; an’ thin we wint to
help with the furniture at the dwellin’-house,
an’ we saved ivery thing we could.”</p>

<p>Silent Mike had done well. Few people
had ever before heard so many words come
in succession from his lips, and he told his
story with such impressive earnestness
that it was easy to believe that he spoke
the truth. Indeed, there was very little
in his account of the occurrence that was
not strictly in accordance with the facts.
He had simply omitted to state that he
and Rennie had gone, first, up to the
breaker and kindled the blaze, and then
returned, hastily, to the crossing where
they certainly were when the first cry of
“Fire!” was heard.</p>

<p>Rennie’s case was looking up. There
was a recess for dinner, and, when court
was re-opened, Sandy McCulloch was put
on the witness-stand.</p>

<p>He was just getting into bed, he said,
when he heard the cry of “Fire!” He
looked out and saw that the breaker was
burning, and, hurrying on his clothes, he
ran down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I cam’ to the fit o’ the hill,” he
continued, in answer to Pleadwell’s question,
“I heard some’at behin’ me, an’ I
lookit aroun’, an’ there I see Jack the
Giant an’ Silent Mike a-speedin’ up the
track toward the breaker.</p>

<p>“The fire was a-burnin’ up brisk by
then, an’ me an’ Jack an’ Mike, we went
an’ pushit some cars out fra the loadin’-place,
down the track; an’ then we savit
a bit fra the dwellin’-house, an’ a bit fra
the engine-room, an’ a bit here an’ there,
as we could; an’ Jack, he workit like a’
possessed, he did, sir; sure he did.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing up so late at
night?” was the first question put to
Sandy on cross-examination.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir, a bit o’ a lad that
works i’ the mines wi’ us, he had lost his
brither i’ the slope the day, he had; an’ I
gied him a promise to help seek him oot
gin he cam’ i’ the evenin’ to say as the lad
was no’ foond; an’ I was a-waitin’ up for
him, min’ ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, did the lad come?” inquired
Lawyer Summons, somewhat sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“He did that, an’ he tellit me as how
he’d foond the brither, an’ leadit him hame,
an’ would na want me; an’ I said ‘good-nicht’
till the lad, an’ started to bed, an’
the clock struckit eleven.”</p>

<p>“Who was the lad that came to your
house?”</p>

<p>“Tom Taylor, sir.”</p>

<p>Rennie started in his seat as the name
was spoken, and the blood mounted into
his pale forehead as he gazed intently at
the witness.</p>

<p>“Did the boy go in the direction of the
breaker from your house?” questioned
Summons.</p>

<p>“He did, sir.”</p>

<p>“How long was it after he left you that
you heard the cry of fire?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe the time o’ ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Could the boy have got beyond the
breaker?”</p>

<p>“He must ’a’, sir, he must ’a’; the grass
was na growin’ under his feet goin’ doon
the hill.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Tom Taylor fired that
breaker?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy stared for a moment in blank
amazement.</p>

<p>“Why, the guid Lord bless ye, mon! be
ye daft? There ain’t a better boy i’ the
roun’ warl’n Tom Taylor!” and Sandy
broke into a hearty laugh at the very idea
of Tom doing any thing wrong.</p>

<p>But Tom, who sat back in his seat and
heard it all, was suddenly startled with the
sense of a new danger. Suppose <em>he</em> should
be charged with setting fire to the breaker?
And suppose Rennie and Carolan should
go upon the witness-stand and swear that
they saw him running away from the newly
kindled blaze, as, indeed, they might and
not lie, either,&mdash;how could he prove his
innocence? Yet he was about to swear
Jack Rennie into freedom, knowing him to
be guilty of the crime with which he was
charged, and, what was still more despicable,
he was about to do it for money.</p>

<p>Looked upon in this light, the thing that
Tom had promised to do rose very black
and ugly in his sight; and the poor delusion
that he should tell no lie was swept,
like a clinging cobweb, from his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while his heart was still throbbing
violently under the excitement of this last
thought and fear, that he heard some one
call,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thomas Taylor!”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” responded Tom.</p>

<p>“Take the witness-stand.”</p>

<small>THE VERDICT.</small></h2>


<p>Pale and trembling, Tom passed out
into the aisle and down around the jury-box,
and stepped upon the little railed
platform.</p>

<p>In impressive tones, the clerk administered
to him the oath, and he kissed the
Holy Bible and swore to “tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”</p>

<p><em>The whole truth!</em></p>

<p>The words echoed and re-echoed through
his mind, as he looked down upon the
lawyers and jurors, and across the bar into
the hundreds of expectant faces turned
toward him. For a moment he felt frightened
and dizzy.</p>

<p>But only for a moment; fear gave place
to astonishment, for Jack Rennie had
started to his feet, with wild eyes and face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
blanched with sudden dread, and, bending
over till his great beard swept Pleadwell’s
shoulder, he whispered, hoarsely, into the
lawyer’s ear, in a tone audible throughout
the room,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ye did na tell me who the lad was!
He mus’ na be sworn; it’s na lawfu’. I’ll
no’ have it; I say I’ll no’ have it!”</p>

<p>In another moment Pleadwell had his
hand on the man’s shoulder, and forced
him into a seat. There was a whispered
consultation of a few minutes between attorney
and client, and then, while Rennie
sat with his eyes turned steadfastly away
from the witness, his huge hand clutching
the edge of the table, and the expression
of nervous dread still on his face, Pleadwell,
calmly, as if there had been no interruption,
proceeded with the examination.</p>

<p>He asked Tom about his residence and
his occupation, and about how blind Bennie
lost himself in the mines. With much
skill, he carried the story forward to the
time when Tom said good-night to Sandy,
and started down the hill toward home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“As you approached the breaker, did
you see a man pass by you in the shadow?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“About how far from you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; ten feet, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p>“Around the corner, by the engine-room.”</p>

<p>“From what point did he come?”</p>

<p>“From the loading-place.”</p>

<p>“How long after he left the loading-place
was it that you saw the first blaze there?”</p>

<p>“Two or three minutes, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Did you see his face?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How did he look? Describe him.”</p>

<p>“He was short and thin, and had no
whiskers.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell pointed to Rennie, and
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Was this the man?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>Pleadwell leaned back in his chair, and
turned to the jury with a smile of triumph
on his face. The people in the court-room
nodded to each other, and whispered,
“That clears Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one, but Jack Rennie himself,
seemed to feel the force of Tom’s testimony.
The prisoner still sat clutching the
table, looking blankly at the wall, pale,
almost trembling, with some suppressed
emotion.</p>

<p>But through Tom’s mind kept echoing
the solemn words of his oath: “The whole
truth; <em>the whole truth</em>.” And he had not
told it; his testimony was no better than a
lie. An awful sense of guilt came pressing
in upon him from above, from below, from
every side. Hateful voices seemed sounding
in his brain: “Perjurer in spirit!
Receiver of bribes!”</p>

<p>The torture of his self-abhorrence, in
that one moment of silence, was terrible
beyond belief.</p>

<p>Then a sudden impulse seized him; a
bright, brave, desperate impulse.</p>

<p>He stepped down from the witness-stand,
passed swiftly between chairs and tables,
tearing the money from his breast-pocket
by the way, and flinging the hated hundred
dollars down before the astonished Pleadwell,
he returned as quickly as he came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stepped into his place with swelling breast
and flaming cheeks and flashing eyes, and
exclaimed, falling, in his excitement, into
the broad accent of his mother tongue,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Noo I’m free! Do what ye wull wi’
me! Prison me, kill me, but I’ll no’ hold
back the truth longer for ony mon, nor a’
the money that ony mon can gi’ me!”</p>

<p>Men started to their feet in astonishment.
Some one back among the people began
to applaud. Jack Rennie turned his face
toward the boy with a look of admiration,
and his eyes were blurred with sudden
tears.</p>

<p>“He’s the son o’ his father!” he exclaimed;
“the son o’ his father! He’s a
braw lad, an’ good luck till him, but it was
flyin’ i’ the face o’ fortune to swear him.
I told ye! I told ye!”</p>

<p>“Who gave you that money?” asked
the district attorney of Tom, when quiet
had been partially restored.</p>

<p>Pleadwell was on his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t answer
that question! Did I give you that
money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Tom, awed by the
man’s vehemence.</p>

<p>“Did Jack Rennie give you that money?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell turned to the court.</p>

<p>“Then if your Honors please, we object
to the witness answering this question.
This is a desperate theatrical trick, concocted
by the prosecution to prejudice this
defendant. We ask that they be not
allowed to support it with illegal evidence.”</p>

<p>The judge turned to Tom.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he asked, “that this
money was given to you by the defendant’s
authority, or by his knowledge or consent?”</p>

<p>“I can’t swear that it was,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“The objection is sustained,” said his
Honor, abruptly.</p>

<p>Pleadwell had gained a point; he might
yet win the day. But the district attorney
would not loose his grip.</p>

<p>“Why did you just give that money to
the attorney for the defence?” he asked.</p>

<p>Pleadwell interposed another objection,
but the court ruled that the question was
properly in the line of cross-examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the defendant’s witness, and Tom answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Cause I had no right to it, an’ he
knows who it belongs to.”</p>

<p>“Whom does it belong to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I only know who
gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“When was it given to you?”</p>

<p>“A week ago last Thursday, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where was it given to you?”</p>

<p>“In Mr. Pleadwell’s office.”</p>

<p>“Was Mr. Pleadwell present?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“How much money was given to you?”</p>

<p>“One hundred dollars, sir.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose was it given to
you?”</p>

<p>“To send my blind brother away to get
his sight.”</p>

<p>“I mean what were you to do in consideration
of receiving the money?”</p>

<p>Before Tom could answer, Pleadwell was
addressing the court:</p>

<p>“I submit, your Honor,” he said, “that
this inquisition has gone far enough. I
protest against my client being prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by the unauthorized and irrelevant conduct
of any one.”</p>

<p>The judge turned to the district attorney.
“Until you can more closely connect the
defendant or his authorized agent,” he said,
“with the giving of this money, we shall
be obliged to restrict you in this course of
inquiry.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell had made another point. He
still felt that the case was not hopeless.</p>

<p>Then Summons, the private counsel for
the prosecution, took the witness. “Tom,”
he said, “did you tell the truth in your
direct examination?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” replied Tom, “but not the
whole truth.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, suppose you tell the rest
of it.”</p>

<p>“I object,” interposed Pleadwell, “to
allowing this witness to ramble over the
field of legal and illegal evidence at will.
If counsel has questions to ask, let him ask
them.”</p>

<p>“We will see that the witness keeps
within proper limits,” said the judge; then,
turning to Tom, “Go on, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Tom, “it was all
just as I told it; only when I got to the
bottom o’ the hill, an’ see that man go by
me in the dark, I was s’prised like, an’ I
stopped an’ listened. An’ then I heard a
noise in under the loadin’-place, an’ then
that man,” pointing his trembling forefinger
to Rennie, “came out, a-kind o’
talkin’ to himself. An’ he said that was
the last job o’ that kind he’d ever do; that
they put it on him ’cause he hadn’t anybody
to feel bad over him if he should get
catched at it.</p>

<p>“An’ then I see a blaze start up right
where he come from, an’ it got bigger an’
bigger. An’ then he turned an’ see me,
an’ he grabbed me by the shoulders, an’ he
said, ‘Don’t you speak nor whisper, or I’ll
take the life o’ ye,’ or somethin’ like that;
I can’t quite remember, I was so scared.
An’ then he pushed me down the track,
an’ he said, ‘Run as fast as ever you can,
an’ don’t you dare to look back.’</p>

<p>“An’ I run, an’ I didn’t look back till
the fire was a-burnin’ up awful; an’ then I
went with the rest to look at it; an’ he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was there, an’ a-workin’ desperate to save
things, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;an’ that’s all.”</p>

<p>Tom stopped, literally panting for breath.
The jurors were leaning forward in their
seats to catch every word, and over among
the crowded benches, where the friends of
the prisoner were gathered, there was a
confused hum of voices, from which, now
and then, rose angry and threatening words.</p>

<p>Rennie sat gazing intently upon Tom, as
though fascinated by the boy’s presence,
but on his face there was no sign of disappointment
or anger; only the same look
of admiration that had come there when
Tom returned the money.</p>

<p>He clutched Pleadwell’s sleeve, and said
to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>“That settles it, mon; that settles it.
The spirit o’ the dead father’s i’ the lad, an’
it’s no use o’ fightin’ it. I’ll plead guilty
noo, an’ end it, an’ tak ma sentence an’
stan’ it. How long’ll it be, think ye?”</p>

<p>“Twenty years in the Penitentiary,” answered
Pleadwell, sharply and shortly.</p>

<p>Rennie dropped back in his chair, as
though the lawyer had struck him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Twenty years!” he repeated; “twenty
years! That’s a main lang time; I canna
stan’ that; I canna live through it. I’ll no’
plead guilty. Do what ye can for me.”</p>

<p>But there was little that Pleadwell could
do now. His worst fears had been realized.
He knew it was running a desperate
risk to place on the witness-stand a boy
with a conscience like Tom’s; but he knew,
also, that if he could get Tom’s story out
in the shape he desired to, and keep back
the objectionable parts, his client would go
free; and he had great faith in the power of
money to salve over a bruised conscience.</p>

<p>He had tried it and failed; and there
was nothing to do now but make the best
of it.</p>

<p>He resumed his calm demeanor, and
turned to Tom with the question,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you ever tell to me the story you
have just now told on the witness-stand,
or any thing like it?”</p>

<p>“I never did,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Did you ever communicate to me, in
any way, your alleged knowledge of Jack
Rennie’s connection with this fire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Pleadwell had established his own innocence,
so far as Tom’s story was concerned
at least, and he dismissed the boy from the
witness-stand with a wave of his hand which
was highly expressive of virtuous indignation.</p>

<p>Tom resumed his seat by the side of
Sandy, whose mouth and eyes were still
wide open with surprise and admiration,
and who exclaimed, as he gave the boy’s
hand a hearty grip,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Weel done, Tommy, ma lad! weel
done! I’m proud o’ ye! an’ Bennie’n the
mither’ll be prouder yet o’ ye!”</p>

<p>And then, for the first time since the
beginning of his trouble, Tom put his face
in his hands and wept. But he felt that
a great load had been lifted from his conscience,
and that now he could look any
man in the eye.</p>

<p>There were two or three unimportant
witnesses sworn in rebuttal and sur-rebuttal,
and the evidence was closed.</p>

<p>Pleadwell rose to address the jury, feeling
that it was a useless task so far as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
client was concerned, but feeling, also, that
he must exert himself to the utmost in
order to rebut a strong presumption of
questionable conduct on his own part.</p>

<p>He denounced Tom’s action in returning
the money to him as a dramatic trick,
gotten up by the prosecution for effect;
and called particular attention to his own
ignorance of the gift of any such money.</p>

<p>He declared Tom’s story of his meeting
with Rennie, on the night of the fire, to be
improbable and false, and argued that since
neither the prosecution, nor the defence,
nor any one else, had ever heard one word
of it till it came out on the witness-stand,
it must, therefore, exist only in the lad’s
heated imagination.</p>

<p>He dwelt strongly on the probable
falsity of the testimony of the so-called
detective; went over carefully the evidence
tending to establish an <em>alibi</em> for
Rennie; spoke with enthusiasm of the
man’s efforts and bravery in the work of
rescue; lashed the corporations for their
indifference to the wrongs of the workingmen;
spoke piteously of the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
law denied to Rennie the right of being
sworn in his own behalf; and closed with
a peroration that brought tears into the
eyes of half the people in the room.</p>

<p>He had made a powerful speech, and he
knew it; but he thought of its effect only
as tending to his own benefit; he had no
hope for Rennie.</p>

<p>Mr. Summons addressed the jury on the
part of the Commonwealth. He maintained
that the evidence of the detective, taken in
connection with all the other circumstances
surrounding the case, was sufficient to have
convicted the defendant, without further
proof.</p>

<p>“But the unexpected testimony,” he declared,
“of one brave and high-minded boy
has placed the guilt of the prisoner beyond
the shadow of a doubt; a boy whose great
heart has caused him to yield to temptation
for the sake of a blind brother; but
whose tender conscience, whose heroic spirit,
has led him to throw off the bonds which
this defence has placed upon him, and, in
the face of all the terrors of an order whose
words are oaths of vengeance, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
acts are deeds of blood, to fling their hated
bribes at their feet, as they sat in the very
court of justice; and to ‘tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,’ for
the sake of his own honor and the upholding
of the law.”</p>

<p>Warming up to his theme, and its possibilities
in the way of oratorical effect,
Summons brought wit to bear upon logic
and logic upon law, and eloquence upon
both, until, at the close of his address, the
conviction of the defendant was all but
certain, and Tom’s position as a hero was
well assured.</p>

<p>Then came the charge of the court;
plain, decisive, reviewing the evidence in
brief, calling the attention of the jury to
their duty both to the Commonwealth and
to the defendant, directing them that the
defendant’s guilt must be established, in
their minds, beyond a reasonable doubt,
before they could convict; but that, if they
should reach that point, then their verdict
should be simply “Guilty.”</p>

<p>The jury passed out of the court-room,
headed by a constable, after which counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
for the defendant filed exceptions to the
charge, and the court proceeded to other
business.</p>

<p>Very few people left the court-room, as
every one supposed it would not be long
before the bringing in of a verdict, and
they were not mistaken. It was barely
half an hour from the time the jury retired
until they filed back again, and resumed
their seats in the jury-box.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury,” said the clerk
of the court, rising, “have you agreed upon
a verdict?”</p>

<p>“We have,” replied the foreman, handing
a paper to a tipstaff, which he handed
to the clerk; and the clerk in turn handed
it to the presiding judge.</p>

<p>The judges, one after another, read the
paper, nodded their approval, and returned
it to the clerk, who glanced over its contents,
and then addressed the jury as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury, hearken unto
your verdict as the court have it recorded.
In the case wherein the Commonwealth is
plaintiff and Jack Rennie is defendant, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
say you find the defendant <em>guilty</em>. So say
you all?”</p>

<p>The members of the jury nodded their
heads, the clerk resumed his seat, and the
trial of Jack Rennie was concluded.</p>

<p>It was what every one had anticipated,
and people began to leave the court-room,
with much noise and confusion.</p>

<p>Rennie was talking, in a low tone, with
Pleadwell and Carolan, while the sheriff,
who had advanced to take charge of the
prisoner, stood waiting for them to conclude
the conference.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the lad harmed,” said
Rennie, talking earnestly to Carolan, “him,
nor his mither, nor his brither; not a hair
o’ his head, nor a mou’-ful o’ his bread,
noo min’ ye&mdash;I ha’ reasons&mdash;the mon
that so much as lays a straw i’ the lad’s
path shall suffer for’t, if I have to live a
hunder’ year to tak’ ma vengeance o’ him!”</p>

<p>The sonorous voice of the court-crier,
adjourning the courts until the following
morning, echoed through the now half-emptied
room, and the sheriff said to
Rennie,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Jack, I’m waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Then ye need na wait longer, for I’m
ready to go wi’ ye, an’ I’m hungry too.”
And Rennie held out his hands to receive
the handcuffs which the sheriff had taken
from his pocket. For some reason, they
would not clasp over the man’s huge
wrists.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the officer, “I have
the wrong pair. Simpson,” turning to his
deputy, “go down to my office and bring
me the large handcuffs lying on my table.”</p>

<p>Simpson started, but the sheriff called
him back.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said, “it won’t pay;
Jack won’t try to get away from us, will
you, Jack?” drawing a revolver from his
pocket as he spoke, and grasping it firmly
in his right hand, with his finger on the
trigger.</p>

<p>“D’ye tak’ me for a fool, mon?” said
Rennie, laughing, as he glanced at the
weapon; then, turning to Carolan and
Pleadwell, he continued, “Good-nicht;
good-nicht and sweet dreams till ye!”
Jack had never seemed in a gayer mood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
than as he marched off through the side-door,
with the sheriff and his deputy;
perhaps it was the gayety of despair.</p>

<p>Carolan had not replied to the prisoner’s
cheery “good-nicht.” He had looked on
at the action of the sheriff, with a curious
expression in his eyes, until the trio started
away, and then he had hurried from the
court-room at a gait which made Pleadwell
stare after him in astonishment.</p>

<p>It was dark outside; very dark. A
heavy fog had come up from the river and
enshrouded the entire city. The street-lamps
shone but dimly through the thick
mist, and a fine rain began to fall, as Tom
and Sandy hurried along to their hotel,
where they were to have supper, before
going, on the late train, to their homes.</p>

<p>Up from the direction of the court-house
came to their ears a confusion of noises;
the shuffling of many feet, loud voices,
hurried calls, two pistol-shots in quick succession;
a huge, panting figure pushing
by them, and disappearing in the fog and
darkness; by and by, excited men hurrying
toward them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>And some one, back in the mist, replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Jack Rennie has escaped!”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>THE FALL.</small></h2>


<p>It was true. Carolan’s quick eye had
noticed the opportunity for Rennie to
escape, and his fertile brain had been swift
in planning an immediate rescue. The few
members of his order that he could find on
the instant were gathered together; there
was a sudden onslaught at a dark corner
of the Court-House Square; the sheriff
and his deputy lay prone upon the ground,
and their prisoner was slipping away
through the dark, foggy streets, with a
policeman’s bullet whizzing past his ears,
and his band of rescuers struggling with
the amazed officers.</p>

<p>But the sheriff of Luzerne County never
saw Jack Rennie again, nor was the hand
of the law ever again laid upon him, in
arrest or punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>As Tom walked home from the railroad
station that night through the drizzling
rain, his heart was lighter than it had been
for many a day.</p>

<p>True, he was nervous and worn with
excitement and fatigue, but there was with
him a sense of duty done, even though
tardily, which brought peace into his mind
and lightness to his footsteps.</p>

<p>After the first greetings were had, and
the little home group of three was seated
together by the fire to question and to talk,
Tom opened his whole heart. While his
mother and Bennie listened silently, often
with tears, he told the story of his adventure
at the breaker on the night of the fire,
of his temptation and fall at Wilkesbarre,
of his mental perplexity and acute suffering,
of the dramatic incidents of the trial,
and of his own release from the bondage
of bribery.</p>

<p>When his tale was done, the poor blind
brother, for whose sake he had stepped into
the shadow of sin, and paid the penalty,
declared, with laughter and with tears, that
he had never before been so proud of Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and so fond of him as he was at that
moment; and the dear, good mother took
the big fellow on her lap, as she used to do
when he was a little child, and held him up
close to her heart, and rocked him till he
fell asleep, and into his curly hair dropped
now and then a tear, that was not the outcome
of sorrow, but of deep maternal joy.</p>

<p>It was well along in December before
the strike came to an end. There had
been rumors for a week of an approaching
compromise between the miners and the
operators, but one day there came word
that all hands were to be at the mines,
ready for work, the following morning.</p>

<p>It was glad news for many a poor family,
who saw the holidays approaching in
company with bitter want; and it brought
especial rejoicing to the little household
dependent so largely on the labor of Tom
and Bennie for subsistence.</p>

<p>The boys were at the entrance to the
mine the next morning before the stars
began to pale in the east. They climbed
into a car of the first trip, and rode down
the slope to the music of echoes roaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
through galleries that had long been
silent.</p>

<p>The mules had been brought in the day
before, and Tom ran whistling to the mine
stables to untie his favorite Billy, and set
him to his accustomed task. There came
soon a half-dozen or more of driver-boys,
and such a shouting and laughing and chattering
ensued as made the beasts prick up
their long ears in amazement.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” shouted Tom, as he fastened
his trace-hook to the first trip of cars.
“Through train to the West! No stops
this side o’ Chicorgo!”</p>

<p>“’Commodation ahead! Parly cars on
the nex’ train, an’ no porters ’lowed!”
squeaked out a little fellow, backing his
mule up to the second trip.</p>

<p>“I’ll poke the fire a bit an’ git the steam
up fur yez,” said Patsy Donnelly, the
most mischievous lad of them all. Whereupon
he prodded Tom’s mule viciously in
the ribs, and that beast began playing such
a tattoo with his heels against the front of
the car as drowned all other noises in its
clatter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whoa, Billy!” shouted Tom, helping
Bennie into the rear car of the trip.
“Whoa, now! Stiddy&mdash;there, git-tup!”
cracking his long leather whip-lash over
Billy’s ears as he spoke, and climbing into
the front car. “Git-tup! Go it! Whoop!”</p>

<p>Away went Tom and Bennie, rattling up
the long heading, imitating alternately the
noise of the bell, the whistle, and the
labored puffing of a locomotive engine;
while the sound-waves, unable to escape
from the narrow passage which confined
them, rolled back into their ears in volumes
of resounding echoes.</p>

<p>Ah, they were happy boys that morning!
happy even though one was smitten with
the desolation of blindness, and both were
compelled to labor, from daylight to dark,
in the grimy recesses of the mine, for the
pittance that brought their daily bread;
happy, because they were young and free-hearted
and innocent, and contented with
their lot.</p>

<p>And Tom was thrice happy, in that he
had rolled away the burden of an accusing
conscience, and felt the high pleasure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
nothing else on earth can so fully bring as
the sense of duty done, against the frowning
face and in the threatening teeth of
danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, there came upon
him a sudden fear of the vengeance he
might meet at Rennie’s hands; but as the
days passed by this fear disturbed him less
and less, and the buoyancy of youth preserved
him from depressing thoughts of
danger.</p>

<p>Billy, too, was in good spirits that morning,
and drew the cars rapidly along the
heading, swinging around the sharp curves
so swiftly that the yellow flame from the
little tin lamp was blown down to the
merest spark of blue; and stopping at last
by the door in the entrance, where Bennie
was to dismount and sit all day at his
lonely task.</p>

<p>Three times Tom went down to the slope
that morning, through Bennie’s door, with
his trip of loads, and three times he came
back, with his trip of lights; and the third
time he stopped to sit with his brother on
the bench and to eat, from the one pail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which served them both, the plain but satisfying
dinner which Mommie had prepared
for them.</p>

<p>Tom was still light-hearted and jovial,
but upon Bennie there seemed to have
fallen since morning a shadow of soberness.
To sit for hours with only one’s thoughts
for company, and with the oppressive
silence broken only at long intervals by the
passing trips, this alone is enough to cast
gloom upon the spirits of the most cheerful.</p>

<p>But something more than this was
weighing upon Bennie’s mind, for he told
Tom, when they had done eating, that
every time it grew still around him, and
there were no cars in the heading or airway,
and no noises to break the silence, he
could hear, somewhere down below him,
the “working” of the mine. He had heard
it all the morning he said, when every
thing was quiet, and, being alone so, it
made him nervous and afraid.</p>

<p>“I could stan’ most any thing,” he said,
“but to get caught in a ‘fall.’”</p>

<p>“Le’s listen an’ see if we can hear it
now,” said Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Then both boys kept very quiet for a
little while, and sure enough, over in the
darkness, they heard an occasional snapping,
like the breaking of dry twigs beneath
the feet.</p>

<p>The process which the miners call “working”
was going on. The pressure of the
overlying mass of rock upon the pillars of
coal left to support it was becoming so
great that it could not be sustained, and
the gradual yielding of the pillars to this
enormous weight was being manifested by
the crackling noises that proceeded from
them, and the crumbling of tiny bits of
coal from their bulging surfaces.</p>

<p>The sound of working pillars is familiar
to frequenters of the mines, and is
the well-known warning which precedes
a fall. The remedy is to place wooden
props beneath the roof for additional support,
and, if this is not done, there comes
a time, sooner or later, when the strained
pillars suddenly give way, and the whole
mass comes crashing down, to fill the gangways
and chambers over an area as great
as that through which the working extended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and to block the progress of mining
for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>Tom had been too long about the mines
to be ignorant of all this, and so had Bennie;
but they knew, too, that the working
often continued weeks, and sometimes
months, before the fall would take place,
though it might, indeed, come at any
moment.</p>

<p>That afternoon Tom told the slope boss
about the working, and he came and made
an examination, and said he thought there
was no immediate danger, but that he would
give orders to have the extra propping of
the place begun on the following day.</p>

<p>“Jimmie Travis said he seen rats goin’
out o’ the slope, though, when he come
in,” said Tom, after relating to Bennie the
opinion of the mine boss.</p>

<p>“Then ’twon’t be long,” replied Bennie,
“’fore the fall comes.”</p>

<p>He was simply echoing the belief of all
miners, that rats will leave a mine in which
a fall is about to take place. Sailors have
the same belief concerning a ship about to
sink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ when the rats begin to go out,”
added Bennie, “it’s time for men an’ boys
to think about goin’ out too.”</p>

<p>Somehow, the child seemed to have a
premonition of disaster.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on very slowly, and
Bennie gave a long sigh of relief when he
heard Tom’s last trip come rumbling down
the airway.</p>

<p>“Give me the dinner-pail, Bennie!”
shouted Tom, as the door closed behind
the last car, “an’ you catch on behind&mdash;Whoa,
Billy!” as the mule trotted on
around the corner into the heading.</p>

<p>“Come, Bennie, quick! Give me your
hand; we’ll have to run to catch him
now.”</p>

<p>But even as the last word trembled on
the boy’s lips, there came a blast of air,
like a mighty wind, and in the next instant
a noise as of bursting thunder, and a crash
that shook the foundations of the mines,
and the two boys were hurled helplessly
against Bennie’s closed door behind them.</p>

<p>The fall had come.</p>

<p>The terrible roar died away in a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of rumbling echoes, and, at last, stillness
reigned.</p>

<p>“Bennie!”</p>

<p>It was Tom who spoke.</p>

<p>“Bennie!”</p>

<p>He called the name somewhat feebly.</p>

<p>“Bennie!”</p>

<p>It was a shout at last, and there was
terror in his voice.</p>

<p>He raised himself to his feet, and stood
leaning against the shattered frame-work
of the door. He felt weak and dizzy. He
was bruised and bleeding, too, but he
did not know it; he was not thinking of
himself, but of Bennie, who had not answered
to his call, and who might be dead.</p>

<p>He was in total darkness, but he had
matches in his pocket. He drew one out
and stood, for a moment, in trembling
hesitancy, dreading what its light might
disclose. Then he struck it, and there,
almost at his feet, lay his cap, with his lamp
still attached to it.</p>

<p>He lighted the lamp and looked farther.</p>

<p>At the other side of the entrance, half-hidden
by the wreck of the door, he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Bennie, lying on his side, quite still. He
bent down and flashed the light into Bennie’s
face. As he did so the blind boy
opened his eyelids, sighed, moved his
hands, and tried to rise.</p>

<p>“Tom!”</p>

<p>The word came in a whisper from his
lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bennie, I’m here; are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;I don’t know; what was
it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“The fall, I guess. Can you get up?
Here, I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>Bennie gained his feet. He was not
much hurt. The door had given way
readily when the boys were forced against
it, and so had broken the severity of the
shock. But both lads had met with some
cuts and some severe bruises.</p>

<p>“Have you got a lamp, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I just found it; come on, let’s
go home.”</p>

<p>Tom took Bennie’s hand and turned to
go out, but the first step around the pillar,
into the heading, brought him face to face
with a wall of solid rock which filled every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
inch of the passage. It had dropped, like
a curtain, blotting out, in one instant, the
mule and the cars, and forming an impassable
barrier to the further progress of the
boys in that direction.</p>

<p>“We can’t get out this way,” said Tom;
“we’ll have to go up through the airway.”</p>

<p>They went back into the airway, and
were met by a similar impenetrable mass.</p>

<p>Then they went up into the short chambers
beyond the airway, and Tom flashed
the light of his lamp into every entrance,
only to find it blocked and barred by the
roof-rock from the fall.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go back up the headin’,”
said Tom, at last, “an’ down through the
old chambers, an’ out to the slope that
way.”</p>

<p>But his voice was weak and cheerless,
for the fear of a terrible possibility had
grown up in his mind. He knew that, if
the fall extended across the old chambers
to the west wall of the mine, as was more
than likely, they were shut in beyond hope
of escape, perhaps beyond hope of rescue;
and if such were to be their fate, then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
would have been far better if they were
lying dead under the fallen rock, with Billy
and the cars.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two boys went up the
heading, to the first opening in the lower
wall, and creeping over the pile of “gob”
that partially blocked the entrance, they
passed down into a series of chambers that
had been worked out years before, from a
heading driven on a lower level.</p>

<p>Striking across through the entrances, in
the direction of the slope, they came, at
last, as Tom had expected and feared, to
the line of the fall: a mass of crushed coal
and broken rock stretching diagonally
across the range of chambers towards the
heading below.</p>

<p>But perhaps it did not reach to that
heading; perhaps the heading itself was
still free from obstruction!</p>

<p>This was the only hope now left; and
Tom grasped Bennie’s hand more tightly
in his, and hurried, almost ran, down the
long, wide chamber, across the airway and
into the heading.</p>

<p>They had gone scarce twenty rods along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the heading, when that cruel, jagged wall
of rock rose up before them, marking the
confines of the most cheerless prison that
ever held a hopeless human being.</p>

<p>When Tom saw it he stopped, and
Bennie said, “Have we come to it,
Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom answered: “It’s there, Bennie,”
and sank down upon a jutting rock, with a
sudden weakness upon him, and drew the
blind boy to a seat beside him.</p>

<p>“We’re shut in, Bennie,” he said. “We’ll
never get out till they break a way into us,
and, maybe, by the time they do that, it’ll
be&mdash;’twon’t be worth while.”</p>

<p>Bennie clung tremblingly to Tom; but,
even in his fright, it came into his mind to
say something reassuring, and, thinking of
his lonesome adventure on the day of the
strike, he whispered, “Well, ’taint so bad
as it might be, Tom; they might ’a’ been
one of us shut up here alone, an’ that’d ’a’
been awful.”</p>

<p>“I wish it had ’a’ been one of us alone,”
answered Tom, “for Mommie’s sake. I
wish it’d ’a’ been only me. Mommie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
couldn’t ever stan’ it to lose&mdash;both of us&mdash;like&mdash;this.”</p>

<p>For their own misfortune, these boys had
not shed a tear; but, at the mention of
Mommie’s name, they both began to weep,
and, for many minutes, the noise of their
sobbing and crying was the only sound
heard in the desolate heading.</p>

<p>Tom was the first to recover.</p>

<p>A sense of the responsibility of the
situation had come to him. He knew that
strength was wasted in tears. And he
knew that the greater the effort towards
physical endurance, towards courage and
manhood, the greater the hope that they
might live until a rescuing party could
reach them. Besides this, it was his place,
as the older and stronger of the two, to be
very brave and cheerful for Bennie’s sake.
So he dried his tears, and fought back his
terror, and spoke soothing words to Bennie,
and even as he did so, his own heart
grew stronger, and he felt better able to
endure until the end, whatever the end
might be.</p>

<p>“God can see us, down in the mine, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as well as He could up there in the sunlight,”
he said to Bennie, “an’ whatever
He’d do for us up there He’ll do for us
down here. An’ there’s them ’at won’t let
us die here, either, w’ile they’ve got hands
to dig us out; an’ I shouldn’t wonder&mdash;I
shouldn’t wonder a bit&mdash;if they were
a-diggin’ for us now.”</p>

<p>After a time, Tom concluded that he
would pass up along the line of the fall,
through the old chambers, and see if there
was not some opening left through which
escape would be possible.</p>

<p>So he took Bennie’s hand again, and led
him slowly up through the abandoned
workings, in and out, to the face of the
fall at every point where it was exposed,
only to find, always, the masses of broken
and tumbled rock, reaching from floor to
roof.</p>

<p>Yet not always! Once, as Tom flashed
the lamp-light up into a blocked entrance,
he discovered a narrow space between the
top of the fallen rock and the roof, and,
releasing Bennie’s hand, and climbing up
to it, with much difficulty, he found that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was able to crawl through into a little open
place in the next chamber.</p>

<p>From here he passed readily through an
unblocked entrance into the second chamber,
and, at some little distance down it, he
found another open entrance. The light
of hope flamed up in his breast as he crept
along over the smooth, sloping surfaces
of fallen rock, across one chamber after
another, nearer and nearer to the slope,
nearer and nearer to freedom, and the
blessed certainty of life. Then, suddenly,
in the midst of his reviving hope, he came
to a place where the closest scrutiny failed
to reveal an opening large enough for even
his small body to force its way through.
Sick at heart, in spite of his self-determined
courage, he crawled back through the fall,
up the free passages and across the slippery
rocks, to where Bennie stood waiting.</p>

<p>“I didn’t find any thing,” he said, in as
strong a voice as he could command.
“Come, le’s go on up.”</p>

<p>He took Bennie’s hand and moved on.
But, as he turned through an entrance into
the next chamber, he was startled to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in the distance, the light of another lamp.
The sharp ears of the blind boy caught the
sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s comin’, Tom,” he said.</p>

<p>“I see the lamp,” Tom answered, “but
I don’t know who it can be. There wasn’t
anybody in the new chambers w’en I started
down with the load. All the men went
out quite a bit ahead o’ me.”</p>

<p>The two boys stood still; the strange
light approached, and, with the light, appeared,
to Tom’s astonished eyes, the huge
form and bearded face of Jack Rennie.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>THE SHADOW OF DEATH.</small></h2>


<p>“Why, lads!” exclaimed Rennie; “lads!”
Then, flashing the light of his lamp into
the boys’ faces, “What, Tom, is it you?
you and the blind brither? Ah! but it’s
main bad for ye, bairnies, main bad&mdash;an’
warse yet for the poor mither at
hame.”</p>

<p>When Tom first recognized Rennie, he
could not speak for fear and amazement.
The sudden thought that he and Bennie
were alone, in the power of this giant
whose liberty he had sworn away, overcame
his courage. But when the kindly
voice and sympathizing words fell on his
ears, his fear departed, and he was ready
to fraternize with the convict, as a companion
in distress.</p>

<p>“Tom,” whispered Bennie, “I know his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
voice. It’s the man ’at talked so kind to
me on the day o’ the strike.”</p>

<p>“I remember ye, laddie,” said Jack.
“I remember ye richt well.” Then, turning
to Tom, “Ye were comin’ up the fall;
did ye find any openin’?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom, speaking for the first
time since the meeting; “none that’s any
good.”</p>

<p>“An’ there’s naught above, either,” replied
Jack; “so we’ve little to do but wait.
Sit ye doon, lads, an’ tell me how ye got
caught.”</p>

<p>Seated on a shelf of rock, Tom told in
a few words how he and Bennie had been
shut in by the fall. Then Jack related to
the boys the story of his escape from the
sheriff, and how his comrades had spirited
him away into these abandoned workings,
and were supplying him with food until
such time as he could safely go out in disguise,
and take ship for Europe.</p>

<p>There he was when the crash came.</p>

<p>“Noo ye mus’ wait wi’ patience,” he
said. “It’ll no’ be for lang; they’ll soon
be a-comin’ for ye. The miners ha’ strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
arms an’ stoot herts, an’ ye’ll hear their
picks a-tap-tappin’ awa’ i’ the headin’&mdash;to-morrow,
mayhap.”</p>

<p>“An’ is it night now?” asked Bennie.</p>

<p>“It mus’ be, lad. I ha’ naught to mark
the time by, but it mus’ be along i’ the
evenin’.”</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted Tom, as the thought
struck him, “if they find you here, you’ll
have to go back to the jail.”</p>

<p>“I ha’ thocht o’ that,” answered Jack.
“I ha’ thocht o’ that, an’ my min’s made
up. I’ll go back, an’ stan’ ma sentence. I
ha’ deserved it. I’d ha’ no peace o’ min’
a-wanderin’ o’er the earth a-keepin’ oot o’
the way o’ the law. An’ maybe, if I lived
ma sentence oot, I could do some’at that’s
better. But I’ll no’ hide any longer; I
canna do it!”</p>

<p>Off somewhere in the fall there was a
grinding, crunching sound for a minute,
and then a muffled crash. Some loosened
portion of the roof had fallen in.</p>

<p>For a long time Jack engaged the boys in
conversation, holding their minds as much
as possible from the fate of imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward midnight Bennie complained of
feeling hungry, and Jack went down into
the old chambers where he had been staying,
and came back after a while with a
basket of food and a couple of coarse blankets,
and then they all went up to Bennie’s
doorway. Tom’s oil was up there, and
their lamps needed filling. It seemed
more like home up there too; and, besides
that, it was the point toward which a rescuing
party would be most likely to work.</p>

<p>Jack’s basket was only partly full of
food, but there would be enough, he
thought, to last, by economical use, during
the following day. He ate none of it himself,
however, and the boys ate but sparingly.</p>

<p>Then they made up a little platform
from the boards and timbers of the ruined
door, and spread the blankets on it, and
induced Bennie, who seemed to be weak
and nervous, to lie down on it and try to
sleep. But the lad was very restless, and
slept only at intervals, as, indeed, did Tom
and Jack, one of whom had stretched
himself out on the bench, while the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sat on the mine floor, reclining against a
pillar.</p>

<p>When they thought it was morning, they
all arose and walked around a little, and
the boys ate another portion of the food
from the basket. But Jack did not touch
it; he was not hungry, he said, and he
went off into the new chambers to explore
the place.</p>

<p>After a while he came back and sat
down, and began telling stories of his boyhood
life in the old country, intermingling
with them many a marvellous tale and
strange adventure, and so he entertained
the boys for hours.</p>

<p>It must have been well on into the afternoon
that Tom took to walking up and
down the heading. Sometimes Jack went
with him, but oftener he remained to talk
with Bennie, who still seemed weak and ill,
and who lay down on the blankets again
later on, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The flame of the little lamp burned up
dimly. More oil and a fresh wick were
put in, but the blaze was still spiritless.</p>

<p>Jack knew well enough what the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was. There were places up in the new
chambers where the deadly carbonic acid
gas was escaping into the prison, adding,
with terrible rapidity, to the amount produced
by exhalation and combustion. But
he said nothing; the boys did not know,
and it would be useless to alarm them
further.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image02.jpg" width="600" height="364"
     alt="Dryden mine" title="Dryden mine" />
</div>

<p>Bennie started and moaned now and then
in his sleep, and finally awoke, crying. He
had had bad dreams, he said.</p>

<p>Jack thought it must be late in the second
evening of their imprisonment.</p>

<p>He took all the food from the basket,
and divided it into three equal parts. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would be better to eat it, he thought, before
actual suffering from hunger began. They
would be better able to hold out in the
end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he laid his portion back in
the basket.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the stomach for it just noo,”
he said. “Mayhap it’ll taste better an’ I
wait a bit.”</p>

<p>There was plenty of water. A little
stream ran down through the airway, from
which the pail had been repeatedly filled.</p>

<p>The night wore on.</p>

<p>The first sound of rescue had not yet
been heard.</p>

<p>By-and-by both boys slept.</p>

<p>Jack alone remained awake and thoughtful.
His face gave token of great physical
suffering. Once he lifted the cover from
the basket, and looked hungrily and longingly
at the little portion of food that remained.
Then he replaced the lid, and set
the basket back resolutely on the ledge.</p>

<p>“No! no!” he murmured. “I mus’ na
tak’ it oot o’ the mou’s o’ Tom Taylor’s
bairns.”</p>

<p>For a long time he sat motionless, with
his chin in his hands, and his eyes fixed on
the sleeping lads. Then, straightening up,
there came into his face a look of heroic
resolution.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” he said, aloud. “It’ll be
better for us a’.”</p>

<p>The sound of his voice awakened Tom,
who had slept for some hours, and who
now arose and began again his monotonous
walk up and down the heading.</p>

<p>After a while, Jack motioned to him to
come and sit beside him on the bench.</p>

<p>“I ha’ summat to say to ye,” he said.
Then, with a glance at the sleeping boy,
“Come ye up the airway a bit.”</p>

<p>The two walked up the airway a short
distance, and sat down on a broken prop
by the side of the track.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Jack, after a moment or two
of silence, “it’s a-goin’ hard wi’ us. Mos’
like it’s near two days sin’ the fall, an’ no
soun’ o’ help yet. Na doot but they’re a-workin’,
but it’ll tak’ lang to get here fra
the time ye hear the first tappin’. The
three o’ us can’t live that lang; mayhap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
two can. Ye s’all be the ones. I ha’ fixed
on that fra the start. That’s why I ha’
ta’en no food.”</p>

<p>“An’ we’ve had it all!” broke in Tom.
“You shouldn’t a-done it. The three of us
ought to a’ fared alike&mdash;’cept, maybe, Bennie;
he aint so strong, an’ he ought to be
favored.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom, the weakes’ first. That’s
richt; that’s why I’m a-givin’ my chances to
you lads. An’ besides that, my life ain’t
worth savin’ any way, alongside o’ yours
an’ Bennie’s. Ye s’all share what’s i’ the
basket atween ye. ’Tain’t much, but it’ll
keep ye up as long’s the air’ll support ye.
It’s a-gettin’ bad, the air is. D’ye min’ the
lomp, how dim an’ lazy-like it burns? A
mon’s got to ha’ such strength as food’ll
give him to hold out lang in air like this.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d ’a’ eaten with us,” interrupted
Tom again. “’Tain’t right to let
your chances go that way on account of
us.”</p>

<p>Paying no attention to this protest, Jack
continued:</p>

<p>“But I’ve a thing on ma min’, Tom, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
I’d feel easier aboot an’ fitter for what’s
a-comin’ if I told it. It’s aboot the father,
lad; it’s aboot Tom Taylor, an’ how he
cam’ to his death. Ye’ll no’ think too hard
o’ me, Tom? It wasna the fall o’ top coal
that killit him&mdash;it was <em>me</em>! Tom! lad!
Tom! bear wi’ me a minute! Sit ye an’
bear wi’ me; it’ll no’ be for lang.”</p>

<p>The boy had risen to his feet, and stood
staring at the man in terrified amazement.
Then Jack rose, in his turn, and hurried on
with his story:</p>

<p>“It wasna by intent, Tom. We were the
best o’ frien’s; I was his butty. We had
a chamber thegither that time i’ the Carbondale
mine. But one day we quarrelled,&mdash;I’ve
no call to say what aboot,&mdash;we
quarrelled there in the chamber, an’ ugly
words passed, an’ there cam’ a moment
when one o’ us struck the ither.</p>

<p>“Then the fight began; han’ to han’;
both lamps oot; a’ in the dark; oh, it was
tarrible! tarrible!&mdash;doon on the floor o’
the mine, crashin’ up against the ragged
pillars, strugglin’ an’ strainin’ like mad&mdash;an’
a’ of a sudden, I heard a sharp cry, an’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
felt him a-slippin’ oot o’ ma arms an’
doon to ma feet, an’ he lay there an’ was
still.</p>

<p>“I foun’ ma lamp an’ lighted it, an’
when I lookit at him, he was dead.</p>

<p>“I was a coward. I was afraid to say
we’d been a-fightin’; I was afraid they’d
say I murdered him. So I blastit doon a
bit o’ roof, an’ fixed it like the top coal’d
killit him; an’ I wasna suspeckit. But I
could na stay there; an’ I wandered west,
an’ I wandered east, an’ I took to drink, an’
to evil deeds, an’ at last I cam’ back,
an’ I went in wi’ the Molly Maguires&mdash;Scotchman
as I was&mdash;an’ I done desperate
work for ’em; work that I oughtn’t to
be alive to-night to speak aboot&mdash;but I
ha’ suffered; O lad, I ha’ suffered!</p>

<p>“Mony an’ mony’s the nicht, as often
as I ha’ slept an’ dreamed, that I ha’ fought
over that fight i’ the dark, an’ felt that body
a-slip, slippin’ oot o’ ma grasp. Oh, it’s
been tarrible, tarrible!”</p>

<p>Jack dropped into his seat again and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>The man’s apparent mental agony melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Tom’s heart, and he sat down beside him
and laid a comforting hand on his knee.</p>

<p>“I have naught against you,” he said,
and repeated, “I have naught against you.”</p>

<p>After a while Jack looked up.</p>

<p>“I believe ye, lad,” he said, “an’ somehow
I feel easier for the tellin’. But ye
mus’ na tell the mither aboot it, Tom; I’ve
a reason for that. I’ve a bit o’ money
here, that I’ve saved along through the
years, an’ I’ve neither kith nor kin that’s
near enow to leave it wi’&mdash;an’ I want she
should have it; an’ if she knew she might
not tak’ it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew, from an inner
pocket, a folded and wrapped package,
and gave it to Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s a matter o’ a thousan’ dollars,” he
continued, “an’ I’d like&mdash;I’d like if a part
o’ it could be used for gettin’ sight for the
blin’ lad, gin he lives to get oot. I told
him, one day, that he should have his
sight, if money’d buy it&mdash;an’ I want to
keep ma ward.”</p>

<p>Tom took the package, too much amazed,
and too deeply moved to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The grinding noise of settling rock came
up from the region of the fall, and then,
for many minutes, the silence was unbroken.</p>

<p>After a while, Jack said, “Put the money
where they’ll find it on ye, gin ye&mdash;gin ye
don’t get oot.”</p>

<p>Then he rose to his feet again.</p>

<p>“You’re not goin’ to leave us?” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, lad, I mus’ go. It’s the way wi’
hunger, sometimes, to mak’ a man crazy
till he’s not knowin’ what he does. Ye
s’all no ha’ that to fear fra me. Tom,”
grasping the boy, suddenly, by both hands,
“don’t come up into the new chambers,
Tom; promise me!”</p>

<p>Tom promised, and Jack added, “Mayhap
I s’all not see ye again&mdash;good-by&mdash;keep
up heart; that’s the gret thing for
both o’ ye&mdash;keep up heart, an’ never let
hope go.”</p>

<p>Then he loosed the boy’s hands, picked
up his lamp, and, with a smile on his face,
he turned away. He passed down the
airway, and out by the entrance where
blind Bennie lay, still sleeping, and stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and looked tenderly down upon him, as
men look, for the last time in life, on those
whom they love.</p>

<p>He bent over, holding his heavy beard
back against his breast, and touched the
tangled hair on the child’s forehead with
his lips; and then, weak, staggering, with
the shadow of his fate upon him, he passed
out on the heading, and up into the new
chambers, where the poisoned air was
heavy with the deadly gas, and the lamp-flame
scarcely left the wick; and neither
Tom Taylor nor his blind brother ever
saw Jack Rennie again, in life or in death.</p>

<p>When Tom went back to the waiting-place,
Bennie awoke.</p>

<p>“I had such a nice dream, Tom,” he
said. “I thought I was a-lyin’ in the little
bed, at home, in the early mornin’; an’ it
was summer, an’ I could hear the birds
a-singin’ in the poplar tree outside; an’
then Mommie she come up by the bed an’
kissed me; an’ then I thought, all of a
sudden, I could see. O Tom, it was
lovely! I could see Mommie a-stannin’
there, an’ I could see the sunlight a-comin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in at the window, an’ a-shinin’ on the floor;
an’ I jumped up an’ looked out, an’ it was
all just like&mdash;just like heaven.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Bennie
added, “Tom, do you s’pose if I should
die now an’ go to heaven, I could see up
there?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered Tom; “but you
aint goin’ to die; we’re goin’ to get out&mdash;both
of us.”</p>

<p>But Bennie was still thinking of the
heavenly vision.</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t care, Tom; I’d just
as lieve die&mdash;if only Mommie could be
with me.”</p>

<p>Again Tom spoke, in earnest, cheerful
tones, of the probability of rescue; and
discussed the subject long, and stimulated
his own heart, as well as Bennie’s, with
renewed hope.</p>

<p>By-and-by the imperious demands of
hunger compelled a resort to the remnant
of food. Tom explained that Jack had
gone away, to be by himself a while, and
wanted them to eat what there was in
the basket. Bennie did not question the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
statement. So the last of the food was
eaten.</p>

<p>After this there was a long period of
quiet waiting, and listening for sounds of
rescue, and, finally, both boys lay down
again and slept.</p>

<p>Hours passed by with no sound save
the labored breathing of the sleepers.
Then Tom awoke, with a prickling sensation
over his entire body, and a strange
heaviness of the head and weakness of the
limbs; but Bennie slept on.</p>

<p>“He might as well sleep,” said Tom, to
himself, “it’ll make the time shorter for
him.”</p>

<p>But by and by Bennie awoke, and said
that he felt very sick, and that his head was
hurting him.</p>

<p>He fell asleep again soon, however,
and it was not until some hours later that
he awoke, with a start, and asked for
water. After that, though oppressed with
drowsiness, he slept only at intervals, and
complained constantly of his head.</p>

<p>Tom cared for him and comforted him,
putting his own sufferings out of sight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
sleeping a little, straining his ears for a
sound of rescue.</p>

<p>The hours crept on, and the flame of
the little lamp burned round and dim, and
the deadly gas grew thicker in the darkness.</p>

<p>Once, after a longer period of quiet
than usual, there came a whisper from
Bennie.</p>

<p>“Tom!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bennie?”</p>

<p>“Where did Jack go?”</p>

<p>“Up in the new chambers.”</p>

<p>“How long’s he been gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a day or two, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Hark, Tom, is that him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear any thing, Bennie.”</p>

<p>“Listen! it’s a kind o’ tappin,’ tappin’&mdash;don’t
you hear it?”</p>

<p>But Tom’s heart was beating so wildly
that he could hear no lesser noise.</p>

<p>“I don’t hear it any more,” said Bennie.</p>

<p>But both boys lay awake now and listened;
and by and by Bennie spoke again,
“There it is; don’t you hear it, Tom?”</p>

<p>This time Tom did hear it; just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
faintest tap, tap, sounding, almost, as
though it were miles away.</p>

<p>There was a little crowbar there, that
had been brought down from the new
chambers. Tom caught it up, and hurried
into the heading, and beat, half a dozen
times, on the wall there, and then, dropping
the bar from sheer exhaustion, he
lay down beside it and listened.</p>

<p>It was hard to tell if they heard his
strokes, though he repeated them again
and again, as his strength would permit.</p>

<p>But the faint tapping ceased only at intervals,
and, once in a long while, a scarcely
perceptible thud could be heard.</p>

<p>Tom crept back to Bennie, and tried to
speak cheeringly, as they lay and listened.</p>

<p>But the blind boy’s limbs had grown
numb, and his head very heavy and painful.
His utterance, too, had become thick and
uncertain, and at times he seemed to be
wandering in his mind. Once he started up,
crying out that the roof was falling on him.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Echoing through the
fall, the sound of pick and crowbar came,
with unmistakable earnestness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom had tapped many times on the wall,
and was sure he had been heard, for the
answering raps had reached his ears distinctly.</p>

<p>But they were so long coming; so long!
Yet Tom nursed his hope, and fought off
the drowsiness that oppressed him, and
tried to care for Bennie.</p>

<p>The blind boy had got beyond caring for
himself. He no longer heard the sounds
of rescue. Once he turned partly on his
side.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mommie,” he whispered, “yes, I
see it; ain’t it pretty!” Then, after a
pause, “O Mommie, how beautiful&mdash;how
beautiful&mdash;it is&mdash;to see!”</p>

<p>Tap, tap, thud, came the sounds of rescue
through the rock and coal.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, thud; but, oh, how the moments
lagged; how the deadly gas increased; how
the sharp teeth of hunger gnawed; how
feebly burned the flame of the little lamp;
how narrow grew the issue between life
and death!</p>

<p>A time had come when Bennie could be
no longer roused to consciousness, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the brain itself had grown torpid, and the
tongue refused to act.</p>

<p>Tap! tap! louder and louder; they were
coming near, men’s voices could be heard;
thud! thud! the prison-wall began to
tremble with the heavy blows; but the
hours went slipping by into the darkness,
and, over the rude couch, whereon the
blind boy lay, the angel of death hung
motionless, with pinions poised for flight.</p>

<p>“O God!” prayed Tom; “O dear God,
let Bennie live until they come!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>OUT OF DARKNESS.</small></h2>


<p>It was with a light heart that the Widow
Taylor kissed her two boys good-by that
morning in December, and watched them
as they disappeared into the fading darkness.
When they were gone she went
about her household duties with a song on
her lips. She did not often sing when she
was alone; but this was such a pretty little
song of a mother and her boy, that on this
happy winter morning she could not choose
but sing it.</p>

<p>Hers were such noble boys, such bright,
brave boys! They had given her heart
and life to begin the struggle for bread, on
that awful day when she found herself
homeless, moneyless, among strangers in
a strange land; when, in answer to her
eager question for her husband, she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
been told that he had met an untimely
death, and was already lying in his grave.</p>

<p>But, as she had toiled and trusted, her
sons had grown, both in stature and in
grace, till they had become, indeed, her
crown of rejoicing.</p>

<p>One thing yet she looked forward to
with eager hope, and that was the time
when her blind boy might have the benefit
of skilful treatment for his eyes, with the
possibility of sight. It might take years
of saving yet, but every day that they
could all work made the time of waiting
one day less. So she was hardly less
rejoiced at the renewal of their tasks than
were the boys themselves.</p>

<p>It was a bright day, and warm, too, for
December; she thought of it afterward,
how fair the day was. But it was lonely
without her boys. It had been weeks
since they had been away from her all day
so; and, long before the sun went down,
she began to wish for their coming.</p>

<p>She made supper early, and set out a
few treasured dainties on the table, in
honor of the first day’s work. Then, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the shadows grew indistinct, and the darkness
settled down upon the earth, she sat
by the window and saw the stars come out,
and waited for her boys.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a jar, the house
rocked slightly, the windows rattled, and a
dish on the pantry-shelf fell to the floor
and was broken.</p>

<p>The Widow Taylor started to her feet,
and stood, for a moment, wondering what it
could mean. Then she opened the door of
her cottage and looked out.</p>

<p>Other women were standing by their
gates, and men were hurrying past her in
the darkness.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” she called out, to
a neighbor.</p>

<p>“A fall,” came back the answer; “it
must ’a’ been a fall.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>She asked the question with a dreadful
apprehension settling down upon her.</p>

<p>“We canna tell; but mos’ like it’s i’ the
Dryden Slope. They’re a-runnin’ that
way.”</p>

<p>The widow shrank back into her house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and sank, weakly, into a chair. For the
moment she was overcome; but only for
the moment. Hope came to her rescue.
There were a hundred chances to one that
her boys were not in the mine, even if the
fall had been there; indeed, it was already
time for them to be at home.</p>

<p>She waited, for a few moments, in anxious
indecision; then, throwing a shawl
about her head and shoulders, she went
out into the night.</p>

<p>She knew very well the route by which
her boys came from their work, and she
determined to go until she should meet
them. There were many people hurrying
toward the slope, but only one man coming
from it, and he was running for a doctor,
and had no time to talk.</p>

<p>Increasing anxiety hastened the widow’s
steps. She could not go fast enough.
Even as it was, people jostled by her in
the darkness, and she ran to keep up with
them.</p>

<p>At last, the mile that lay between her
cottage and the mine was almost covered.
Up on the hillside, at the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
slope, she saw the twinkling and glancing
of the lights of many lamps. The crowds
had grown more dense. Other women were
pushing past her, moaning and lamenting.</p>

<p>She climbed the hill, and through the
throng, to where a heavy rope had been
stretched about the mouth of the slope, as
a barrier to hold back the pressing crowd;
and clutching the rope with both hands,
she stood there and waited and watched.</p>

<p>She was where she could see into the
opening of the mine, and where she could
see all who came out.</p>

<p>Some cars were lowered from the slope-house
to the mouth, and a dozen men,
with picks and crowbars, climbed into
them and went speeding down into the
blackness. It was another rescuing party.</p>

<p>Across the open space before her, the
widow saw Sandy McCulloch coming, and
cried out to him, “Sandy!”</p>

<p>He stopped for an instant, then, recognizing
the woman’s voice, he came up to
her, and laid his hands on hers, and, before
she could speak again, he said, “Ye’re
lookin’ for the lads. They’re no’ come oot
yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sandy&mdash;are they safe?”</p>

<p>“We canna tell. There was mony ’at
got this side o’ the fall afoor it comed; an’
some ’at got catched in it; an’ mos’ like
there be some ’at’s beyon’ it.”</p>

<p>A car came up the slope, and the body
of a man was lifted out, placed on a rude
stretcher, and carried by.</p>

<p>Sandy moved, awkwardly, to get between
the dread sight and the woman’s eyes.
But she looked at it only for a moment.
It was a man; and those she sought were
not men, but boys.</p>

<p>“They’re a-workin’,” continued Sandy,
“they’re a-workin’ like tigers to get to ’em,
an’ we’re a-hopin’; that’s a’ we can do&mdash;work
an’ hope.”</p>

<p>The man hurried away and left her, still
standing there, to watch the car that came
up from the blackness, at lengthening intervals,
with its dreadful load, and to hear
the shrill cry from some heart-broken wife
and mother, as she recognized the victim.
But they were always men who were
brought out, not boys.</p>

<p>After a time, a party of workers came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
up, exhausted, and others went down in
their places. The men were surrounded
with eager questioners, but they had little
to say. The work of rescue was progressing,
that was all.</p>

<p>By and by Sandy came back.</p>

<p>“Ye should no stay here, Mistress Taylor,”
he said. “When the lads be found ye
s’all know it; I’ll bring ’em to ye mysel’.
Mos’ like they’re back o’ the fall, an’ it’ll
tak’ time to get ’em&mdash;all nicht maybe,
maybe longer; but when they’re found, ye
s’all not be long knowin’ it.”</p>

<p>“O Sandy! ye’ll spare naught; ye’ll
spare naught for ’em?”</p>

<p>“We’ll spare naught,” he said.</p>

<p>He had started with her towards home,
helping her along until the bend in the
road disclosed the light in her cottage window;
and then, bidding her to be hopeful,
and of strong heart, he left her, and hurried
back to aid in the work of rescue.</p>

<p>The outer line of the fall, and the openings
into it, had already been searched;
and all the missing had been accounted for&mdash;some
living, some dead, and some to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
whom death would have been a happy relief&mdash;all
the missing, save Tom Taylor and
his blind brother.</p>

<p>It was well known that their route to the
foot of the slope lay by the new north
heading; and, along this passage, the entire
work of rescue was now concentrated.
The boys would be found, either buried
under the fall, or imprisoned back of it.</p>

<p>At some points in the heading, the rescuing
parties found the rock and coal wedged
in so solidly that the opening of a few feet
was the work of an hour; again, the huge
blocks and slabs were piled up, irregularly;
and, again, there would be short distances
that were wholly clear.</p>

<p>But no matter what these miners met,
their work never for one moment ceased
nor lagged. They said little; men do not
talk much under a pressure like that; but
every muscle was tense, every sense on the
alert; they were at the supreme height of
physical effort.</p>

<p>Such labor was possible only for a few
hours at a time, but the tools scarcely
ceased in their motion, so quickly were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
they caught up by fresh hands, from the
exhausted ones that dropped them.</p>

<p>Men do not work like that for money.
No riches of earth could charge nerve and
muscle with such energetic fire. It was,
indeed, a labor of love.</p>

<p>There was not a workman in Dryden
Slope but would have worn his fingers to
the bone to save these lads, or their widowed
mother, from one hour of suffering.
The frank, manly character of Tom, and
the pathetic simplicity of his blind brother,
had made both boys the favorites of the
mine. And beneath the grimy clothes of
these rugged miners, beat hearts as warm
and resolute as ever moved the noblest of
earth’s heroes to generous deeds of daring.</p>

<p>When the Widow Taylor reached home
it was almost midnight. She set away the
supper-dishes from the table, and, in place
of them, she put some of her simple household
remedies. She prepared bandages
and lint, and made every thing ready for
the restoration and comfort of the sufferers
when they should arrive.</p>

<p>She expected that they would be weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
wounded, too, perhaps; but she had not
yet thought of them as dead.</p>

<p>Then she lay down upon her bed and
tried to sleep; but at every noise she wakened;
at every passing foot-fall she started
to her feet.</p>

<p>At daybreak a miner stopped, with blackened
face and bleeding hands, to tell her
that the work of rescue was going bravely
on. He had, himself, just come from the
face of the new opening, he said; and
would go back again, to work, after he had
taken a little food and a little sleep.</p>

<p>The morning went by; noon passed, and
still no other tidings. The monotony of
waiting became unbearable at last, and the
stricken woman started on another journey
to the mine.</p>

<p>When she came near to the mouth of
the slope, they made way for her in silent
sympathy. A trip of cars came out soon
after her arrival, and a half-dozen miners
lifted themselves wearily to the ground.
The crowd pressed forward with eager
questions, but the tired workers only shook
their heads. They feared, they said, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not half the distance through the fall had
yet been accomplished.</p>

<p>But one of them, a brawny, great-hearted
Irishman, came over to where the Widow
Taylor stood, white-faced and eager-eyed,
and said, “It won’t be long now, ma’am,
till we’ll be afther rachin’ ’em. We’re a-hopin’
every blissed hour to break through
to where the purty lads is a-sthayin’.”</p>

<p>She started to ask some question, but
he interrupted her:</p>

<p>“Oh, av coorse! av coorse! It’s alive
they are, sure; an’ hearty; a bit hungry
like, maybe, an’ no wondher; but safe,
ma’am, as safe as av ye had the both o’
thim in your own house, an’ the dure locked
behind yez.”</p>

<p>“An’ do ye find no signs?” she asked.
“Do ye hear no sounds?”</p>

<p>“Ah, now!” evading the question; “niver
ye fear. Ye’ll see both childer a-laughin’
in your face or ever the mornin’ dawns
again, or Larry Flannigan’s word’s no
betther than a lie.”</p>

<p>She turned away and went home again,
and the long night passed, and the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dawned, and Larry Flannigan’s word was,
indeed, no better than a lie.</p>

<p>It was only the same old story: “They’re
a-workin’. It can’t be long now.”</p>

<p>But among themselves the miners said
that had the lads escaped the fall, they
would perish from hunger and foul air long
before the way could be opened into their
prison. To bring their lifeless bodies out
for decent burial was all that could be
hoped.</p>

<p>The morning of the fourth day dawned,
beautiful and sunny. It was the holy
Christmas Day; the day on which the star-led
shepherds found the Christ-child in the
hallowed manger in the town of Bethlehem.
White and pure upon the earth, in the
winter sunlight, rested a covering of newly
fallen snow; and, pale-faced and hollow-eyed,
the mother of the two imprisoned
boys looked out upon it from the window
of her desolated home.</p>

<p>The sympathizing neighbors who had
kept her company for the night had gone
for a little while, and she was alone.</p>

<p>She knew that there was no hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>They had thought it a kindness to tell
her so at last, and she had thanked them for
not keeping the bitter truth hid from her.</p>

<p>She did not ask any more that she might
see her two boys in life; she only prayed
now that their dear bodies might be brought
to her unmangled, to be robed for Christian
burial.</p>

<p>To this end she began now to make all
things ready. She put in order the little
best room; she laid out the clean, new
clothing, and the spotless sheets; she even
took from her worn purse the four small
coins to place upon the white, closed lids.</p>

<p>In the locked cupboard, where the boys
should not see them till the time came,
she found the Christmas presents she had
thought to give to them this day.</p>

<p>Not much, indeed. A few cheap toys,
some sweetmeats purchased secretly, a book
or two, and, last of all, some little gifts that
her own weary, loving hands had wrought
in the long hours after the children were
asleep.</p>

<p>And now the Christmas dawn had come;
but the children&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not wept before, not since the
first jar from the fall had rocked her cottage;
but now, with the sight of these poor, simple
Christmas gifts, there came some softening
influence that moved her heart, and brought
the swift tears to her eyes, and she sat
down in her accustomed chair and wept&mdash;wept
long and piteously, indeed, but in the
weeping found relief.</p>

<p>She was aroused by a knock at the door.
The latch was lifted, the door pushed open,
and Sandy McCulloch stumbled in. He
was out of breath, his eyes were wide with
excitement, and down each side of his grimy
face was a furrow where the tears had run.</p>

<p>The widow started to her feet.</p>

<p>“Sandy!”</p>

<p>A wild hope had come into her heart.</p>

<p>“They’re found!” he forced out breath
enough to say.</p>

<p>“O Sandy, alive or&mdash;or”&mdash;</p>

<p>She could not finish the question; the
room seemed whirling round her; she
grasped at the chair for support.</p>

<p>“Alive!” he shouted. “Alive, an’ a-goin’
to live!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He started forward, and caught the woman
as she fell. The shock of joy had been too
sudden and too great, and for a time nature
gave way before it.</p>

<p>But it was indeed true. When the men,
working at the face of the tunnel, caught
the sound of responsive tappings, they
labored with redoubled energy, if such a
thing could be, and, after another night of
most gigantic effort, they broke through
into the prison-house, to find both boys
unconscious indeed, but alive, alive.</p>

<p>Medical aid was at hand, and though for
a time the spirit of Bennie seemed fain to
leave his wasted body, it took a firmer hold
at last, and it was known that he would
live.</p>

<p>In triumphant procession, they bore the
rescued, still unconscious, boys in tender
haste to their mother’s house; and those
who ran before shouted, “Found! found!”
and those who followed after cried, “Alive!
alive!”</p>

<p>How the women kissed their own children
and wept, as they saw the lads borne
by! How the men grasped one another’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
hands, and tried to speak without a tremor
in the voice&mdash;and failed. And how wild
the whole town went over the gallant rescue
of the widow’s sons!</p>

<p>But Jack Rennie, poor Jack, brave, misguided
Jack! They found his body later
on, and gave it tender burial. But it was
only when the lips of Tom and Bennie
were unsealed, with growing strength, that
others knew how this man’s heroic sacrifice
had made it possible for these two boys to
live.</p>

<p>Under the most watchful and tender care
of his mother, Tom soon recovered his
usual health. But for Bennie the shock
had been more severe. He gained strength
very slowly, indeed. He could not free his
mind from dreadful memories. Many a
winter night he started from his sleep,
awakened by dreams of falling mines.</p>

<p>It was not until the warm, south winds
of April crept up the valley of Wyoming,
that he could leave his easy-chair without
a hand to help him; and not until all the
sweet roses of June were in blossom that
he walked abroad in the sunlight as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>But then&mdash;oh, then what happened?
Only this: that Jack Rennie’s gift was put
to the use he had bespoken for it; that
skilled hands in the great city gave proper
treatment to the blind boy’s eyes through
many weeks, and then&mdash;he saw! Only
this; but it was life to him,&mdash;new, sweet,
joyous life.</p>

<p>One day he stepped upon the train, with
sight restored, to ride back to his valley
home. Wide-eyed he was; exuberant with
hope and fancy, seeing all things, talking
to those about him, asking many questions.</p>

<p>The full and perfect beauty of late summer
rested on the land. The fields were
never more luxuriantly green and golden,
nor the trees more richly clothed with
verdure. The first faint breath of coming
autumn had touched the landscape here
and there with spots of glowing color, and
the red and yellow fruit hung temptingly
among the leaves of all the orchard trees.</p>

<p>The waters of the river, up whose winding
course the train ran on and on, were
sparkling in the sunlight with a beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that, in this boy’s eyes, was little less than
magical.</p>

<p>And the hills; how high the hills were!
Bennie said he never dreamed the hills
could be so high.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” he said, again and again,
as the ever changing landscapes formed
and faded in his sight; “beautiful! beautiful!”</p>

<p>Before the train reached Wilkesbarre the
summer evening had fallen, and from that
city, up the valley of Wyoming, Bennie
saw from the car-window only the twinkling
of many lights.</p>

<p>Tom was at the station to meet him.
Dear, brave Tom, how his heart swelled
with pride, as, by some unaccountable instinct,
Bennie came to him, and called
him by name, and put his arms around
his neck.</p>

<p>Many were there to see the once blind
boy, and give him welcome home. And
as they grasped his hand, and marked his
happiness, some laughed for joy, and others,&mdash;for
the same reason indeed,&mdash;others
wept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they started on the long home
walk, Tom and Bennie, hand in hand together,
as they used to go hand in hand,
to find and greet the mother.</p>

<p>She was waiting for them; sitting by the
window in her chair, as she had sat that
dreadful winter night; but there came now
no sudden jar to send a pallor to her face;
she heard, instead, the light footsteps of
her two boys on the walk, and their voices
at the door; and then&mdash;why, then, she
had Bennie in her arms, and he was saying&mdash;strange
that they should be the very
words that passed his lips that awful hour
when death hung over him&mdash;he was saying,
“O Mommie! how beautiful&mdash;how
beautiful&mdash;it is&mdash;to see!”</p>
